## Last-minute questions

This session tends to be left as open for students to bring along questions. By this point, they are nearing the end of the process and they all have niggling questions that is then quite helpful to cover as a whole group.

I don't prepare anything in advance for this, other than reminding the students on teams to come along with their questions. I will also remind them that we are going to do a practice presentation in Week 11 and confirm the details with them (place, day and time). 

### Expected progress

-   By week 9, students will be around 1-2 weeks away from submitting
-   All analysis sections should be submitted by now, and - if there are any drafts left outstanding - I will prioritise getting feedback back as quickly as I can, so that they can apply this in time.
-   Students should have already done peer review for their Discussion if they are doing this, and should be working on the final edits.
