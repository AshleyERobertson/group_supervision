However, as the resources are made available from the start, you will also have some flexibility to work at a pace that suits you.\nYou will become familiar with the book in Semester 1, as we will ask you to look at certain sections to accompany the lecture content. However, the book will become most relevant in Semester 2, when you complete your larger assignments.\nYou will find links to each chapter at the left hand side of the page, and then there will be links to each heading within a chapter at the right hand side."

    "title": "Structured Group Supervision",
    "section": "How I structure my supervision",
    "text": "How I structure my supervision\nThe way I run my dissertation supervision is:\n\nLevel 4 students have a combination of individual supervision and group supervision (switching between each on a weekly basis). I, personally, like having both types rather than just doing group or individual.\nPGT ODL students have individual supervision (30 mins) on a fortnightly basis (this is because they are part-time and online distance-learning). I also hold a couple of group sessions through the year to get them in touch with each other so they can provide peer support, although many work full-time or in schools etc., which combined with time zones, makes it difficult to find a time to suit everyone. I record these so everyone can benefit.\n\nTherefore, most of these resources apply to my UG dissertation students, but could easily be applied to PGT, especially those studying on campus.\n\nSetting expectations with students\nIn 23-24, I made up sways to detail the supervision process for both Level 4 students and ODL students. They were well-received, but the students who went out of their way to tell me that they found it helpful were those who were neurodivergent, as it meant they knew what to expect. I think they would also be quite helpful for international students, as previous supervision experiences at university might have been very different.\nI’ve linked to examples of the sways above (please feel free to duplicate for your own use), but have also included the content in Appendix A\n\n\nJoint deadline document\nI use a deadline document for each cohort of supervisees. This details deadlines (I keep them as soft deadlines, but others might decide to do hard deadlines) and also notes when each draft was received and when I returned feedback.\nIt means I can keep on top of a) where each student is in the process, b) the order in which I receive sections (and therefore have to give feedback), and c) allows students to know where their draft is in the ‘queue’ (which might reduce unrealistic expectations of a return within a short timescale!). I allow students to view the spreadsheet but they are not able to edit it, meaning they can’t change a deadline without talking to me about it.\nExamples of deadline documents:\n\nLevel 4 students deadline document\nPGT ODL students deadline document\n\n\n\n‘Themed’ supervision\nI’ve taken an approach of doing themed sessions in supervision, covering things that everyone will need to know about and also incorporating the dissemination of resources for students. Some of these are resources I made up, some are resources from UoG SPaN staff members and others are from external sources.\nStudents have said they’ve found the resources helpful and have applied them to some of their other courses. I used to have the group sessions in the even weeks, but then some students go away for reading week, so I’ve moved them to the odd weeks.\nThe below structure is based on a dissertation starting in September (Semester 1 Week 1) and ending in mid-March (Semester 2 Week 10). This is likely to differ based on discipline and University.\nLevel 4 group supervision is as follows:\n\nSemester 1 Week 1 - Getting to know each other, topics, proposals\n\nSemester 1 Week 3 - Ethics, research questions\n\nSemester 1 Week 5 - Summarising papers, writing, bullet point introductions\n\nSemester 1 Week 7 - Discussing the bullet point intros (students to bring bullet point intros), participant recruitment, reducing perfectionism\n\nSemester 1 Week 9 - Collecting data, developing evaluation (intro)\n\nSemester 1 Week 11 - Structure (i.e. reverse outlines), JARS guidelines\nSemester 2 Week 1 - Receiving and applying feedback, presenting work\nSemester 2 Week 3 - Analysis (quant and qual) - students to bring questions\nSemester 2 Week 5 - Developing evaluation (discussion), peer review of discussion\nSemester 2 Week 7 - No-stakes presentations - all students will present a 5 min summary of study findings so far\nSemester 2 Week 9 - Final group session - students to bring questions\nSemester 2 Week 11 - LONGER SESSION - celebration and practice talks for UG conference/BPS. Students to bring presentation slides\n\nAlthough dissertation hand-in is the Friday of Semester 2 Week 10 and so supervision has technically ended, as students were anxious about presenting their research I held an extra group session in Week 11 so they could do practice talks a few days before the UG conference. I will keep this for future years as students reported finding it supportive.\nI do individual supervision in the even weeks, and do 30 mins per person. Other models that supervisors use is to do group supervision every week or some do one week group supervision, one week drop-in."

I have some below, but in our first group meeting, I will ask you to think about whether there are any you would like to add, or if there is anything you want to amend related to the points below.\n\nA.2.1 Communication\nI ask that all students working with me communicate with me, letting me know if they are unable to make a certain deadline or if something gets in the way of a task they had planned for a specific point in time. In return, I will communicate with you regularly, including when you can expect feedback, and will do my best to let you know if I have to delay something beyond what I had previously communicated.\n\n\nA.2.2 Attendance\nI ask that all students attend group sessions unless there is something urgent that has come up. Individual sessions are more flexible and can be cancelled if you feel that you don’t need to meet in a particular week (although please let me know in advance if this is the case). Group sessions are held for 1h every fortnight, with individual sessions being 30 mins, held in the weeks that we are not meeting as a group.\n\n\nA.2.3 Supportive space\nI want the dissertation group to be an encouraging, safe, space and the dissertation process to be an enjoyable (albeit challenging at points!) experience for everyone. This means that you should never hesitate to ask any questions (all questions are valid) and I’d like us all to work together to support each other. No one is perfect and we will all make mistakes during the process (including me). I’ve been supervising for quite a few years now and I haven’t yet managed to come across anything that we have been unable to sort after some discussion, so don’t worry about talking to me if something has gone wrong :)."

I will ask you to work with me to set these deadlines so that we agree them together.\n\nA.4.1 Ethics\nWe will prioritise the ethics application from the very start - the reason for this is that you cannot recruit data unless you have your ethics approved, meaning that delayed applications can bring a project to a halt.\n\n\nA.4.2 Dissertation\nDissertation section deadlines are not set in stone - I would much rather that you take an extra day or two if you need it rather than sending an unfinished draft (with the caveat that it will never be perfect). If this is the case, let me know and we can discuss options.\nAlthough it is unusual for this to be an issue, there will be a point where I am no longer able to look over drafts before the deadline. We will aim for dates before this, but my cut-off is that I don’t accept drafts once we reach 1st March. This is because it becomes very unlikely that I will be able to turn around feedback in time for you to be able to make meaningful changes by the submission .deadline in mid-March."

For dissertation section drafts, I will usually aim to provide feedback within two weeks. This is because drafts tend to be in semester 2, when I have most of my teaching. Depending on my teaching/marking commitments, this may take longer, but I will communicate with you about this at the time. You will also be able to see where you are in the ‘feedback queue’ in the shared deadlines document.\n\n\nA.6.2 What type of feedback you will receive\nI generally provide in-text comments, so that I can show you which part am I referring to in my feedback (where relevant). I will also give a global overview/summary. I will tend to focus on what can be improved, as this is the priority to help your writing develop. However, I will also let you know what you do well too.\n\n\nA.6.3 How you can ask for specific feedback\nIf you have specific parts you would like feedback on (e.g. if you are unsure about something), you can leave comments in your document (either at specific points or at the start) and I will respond to them when I am reading through. Try not to put the points you’d like feedback on in the message when you send the file to me, as I put the files elsewhere and don’t tend to refer back to messages. This makes it more likely that I’ll miss them if they aren’t contained in the document when I come to read it.\n\n\nA.6.4 What format should be sent for the drafts?\nAll documents (proposal, ethics, Intro, Methods, Results/Analysis) should be in Word. An exception to this is copies of standardised measures (this might be in pdf, which is fine)."

Here, we will tend to catch up on how your project is going, and you will have the opportunity to ask questions. These may be used more often at certain points in the year (e.g. getting ethics together) than others (e.g. once your data collection is all set up).\nMost people come along every week, but if you find one week that you don’t need to meet, it’s not an issue - just let me know and we can cancel it."

If the bullet point intros take longer than expected, I’ll pass the resources on to the students to review outside the session.\n\n4.1.1 Expected progress\n\nAround now, I would expect most ethics applications to be submitted (or in the final stages of draft) (especially if it’s going through College rather than the intranet)\nStudents will have made a rough outline of their introduction and will have done background reading\nI will usually ask students to pick a deadline for their Introduction around now, adding it to the shared deadlines spreadsheet\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Bullet point introductions\n\nWe then spend most of the session discussing the bullet point introductions.\n\nEach person talks about their project and what they currently think about for their introduction in terms of structure\nI will then give some feedback on these and students can also ask questions etc.\nIt’s quite a good opportunity for the whole group to understand what everyone is doing for their project\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Participant recruitment\n\nIf we have time, I will cover participant recruitment first, then reducing perfectionism\n\nWhat are students’ plans for recruitment?\nDo they foresee any difficulties? If so, is there anything we can put in place now to mitigate these?\nThings to think about:\n\nWhat are the backup plans? What if the students need to recruit more people?\nAre any gatekeepers needed?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Reducing perfectionism\n\nI talk about perfectionism and how it can be quite a big barrier in terms of not wanting to ‘let go’ of things\n\nRemind students that a draft is just that: a draft. It’s not the final version and doesn’t need to be seen by anyone else.\n\nI talk about my own experiences of it as a student and what I found helped me:\n\nBreaking things into small chunks\nReminding myself that feedback will help make it stronger in the end\n\nI tend to add the below external resources to Teams and let students engage with them if they want"

Other supervisors may differ on this, but it’s caused issues in the past (see examples above).\n\nStudents need Emily’s extended debrief if going to recruit Level 1 students\nSONA is used to recruit Level 1 students (students should see Emily’s sway on how to do this)\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Data Collection (Qual projects)\n\nHow are students collecting data?\n\nIf online, must use GDPR-approved system (e.g. Zoom or Teams)\nIf in person, will need a) appropriate recording equipment, b) a quiet space\n\nSome supervisors differ on their opinions on this, but I ask students to send out questions in advance for all participants, as it can be more accessible for certain people (e.g. those who are neurodivergent or who don’t speak English as a first language)\nI ask students how they are feeling about collecting data. Typically, they can be a bit nervous\n\nImportant to practise setting things up/recording etc.\nGood to pilot things (e.g. with a friend). I’m also happy to help in office hours etc.\nCan practise with each other (i.e. others in the group) to help get comfortable\nCan be helpful to write a list of everything need to cover at the start and end so that they don’t forget anything\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Evaluation in introductions\nIn RM2, Wil and I have made some excerpts from intros and discussions for our labs.

It’s good to touch base and see where everyone is at in their projects, as things tend to start winding down (especially recruitment-wise) for the festive period.\nIn this session, I cover structure (specifically thinking about reverse outlines, so that larger structure of a document) and we also discuss the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS).\nI tend to reiterate to the students how important it is to get some rest over Christmas, and what they are looking forward to in Semester 2. I also mention the BPS conference and ask them to have a think about presenting there next semester.\n\n6.1.1 Expected progress\n\nI may have seen a few intros at this point, but it’s likely students are still working on these.\nSome students will usually have started data collection.\nHopefully all ethical approvals should be back by now\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Structure\n\nI mainly cover structure between paragraphs rather than within them here, but if you wanted to cover structure in a paragraph, there are some useful resources on PEEL in Chapter 20.2 of the Research Methods 1 book.\nI use the Reverse Outlines resource to discuss reviewing structure of a particular section (e.g. the Introduction)\nSome things we discuss:\n\na broad –&gt; narrow structure can be helpful for the introduction (and the reverse for the discussion)\nare you covering one main point per paragraph or trying to squeeze too many in?\ntry to think about the reader when writing - what do they know at each point?\ndoes your reverse outline make sense? For example, does it jump around between topics or does the structure flow clearly?\nif covering quite disjointed topics in the intro, it might be worth considering using sub-headings\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) and other resources\n\nIn the second half of the session, we cover JARS guidelines. These are very useful, particularly for the methods sections and often results too (there tends to be less guidance on intro/discussion).\nThe guidelines give some insight into what students might want to include, and has some suggestions for people who would be reviewing an article (i.e. what might they look for) which are useful to know\n\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Qual)\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Quant)\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Mixed Methods)\n\nIn addition, there have been Journal Article Reporting Standards for Race, Ethnicity, and Culture released\n\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Race, Ethnicity and Culture)\n\nAs most of my research has been in autism, if I have any students working on this topic, I share a resource by Bottema-Beutel et al (2021) on avoiding ableist language"

They should also be working on their Methods.\nStudents should be recruiting participants by now\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Receiving and applying feedback\n\nAs part of the group session, I talk about the type of feedback I give (i.e. what students can expect when they receive feedback from me).\nI also tell them how they can get the most out of the feedback that I give (e.g. asking questions after receiving it, leaving comments in their work for me to respond to)\nThis will be individual to each supervisor, but I’ve provided a summary of what I discuss with the students below. I don’t give them this, but it has the main things I talk about in the discussion.\nI cover a few, select, parts of the external resources linked below and we discuss how they might be able to apply these to their work in semester 2.\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Presentations\n\nI’ve noticed that quite a few students I supervise are nervous about presenting, so I talk to them about how they feel about it.\nWe discuss presenting their dissertation research, and I encourage them to take the opportunity to present when they get it. Although it can be anxiety provoking, it helps equip them with useful employability skills\nI then highlight the Level 4 conference at the end of the semester, and the BPS conference that is usually at the end of March/beginning of April. I tell students that to support these, we will a) practice running through findings in the group (week 7) and we will b) book out a room to do a proper practice with slides (week 11). Both of these are no stakes and the purpose is to help students practice communicating their research in a safe environment.\nWe then discuss some of my tips for this (caveat: others may disagree) and together we plan out some concrete actions of what they could do to improve their experiences of presenting."

I think I had a mixture of ones that students had posted on teams (with me saying I’d answer in the group session) and others that were asked only in the session.\nThe students found it a useful experience, even if they hadn’t thought much about it as those who were a bit further behind got answers to questions they hadn’t thought of yet.\n\n\n8.1.3 Qual resource\nFor any qual students, I give them Activity 2 from Lab 9 in RM2, and ask them what they think about the depth.\n\n\n8.1.4 Quant resource\nFor any quant students, I remind them about the PsyTeachR resources. Although they will be aware of the books they had in Levels 1 through 3, they will be less likely to know about the MSc resources. Over the past few years, I’ve had students find the MSc Conversion book useful, in particular,\n\n\n8.1.5 Looking over excerpts of results/analysis\n\nBefore the session, I will have prepared some results/analysis extracts from previous dissertations. I then give these out during the session and we discuss:\n\nwhat they liked/what worked well\n\nwhat they felt could be improved\none concrete thing that they might take forward when they come to write their own analysis section\n\n\n\nI also flag that these are not all A1 examples. The stuednts usually say they are surprised by how different they are, and this leads to a discussion about key things being covered but it’s not ‘one size fits all’."

    "text": "3.2 Focus group structure\nThere are a number of stages to a focus group, and it’s not always exactly the same, but here is an example structure for a focus group:\n\nStage 1: Setting the scene. The topic of the project should be introduced by the facilitator, and everyone agrees to take part. It must be made clear to the people in your focus group a) that they do not have to answer any questions that they do not feel comfortable with, b) highlight that the session will be recorded (if conducting your study online, also make sure to let your participants know they have a choice to have their camera on or off, but that the mic must be used), c) what will happen with the recordings (i.e. that they will be kept safe on University-approved servers and the transcript anonymised), d) that everyone has a responsibility to maintain confidentiality of the topics discussed in the group and e) that they are free to leave the session at any time. Run through the Information Sheet and Consent Form here, and discuss any ground rules you have. I would also raise the point here that there are a few questions to get through, and therefore you might have to step in to help manage time.\nStage 2: Recording. Remember to start recording and let your participants know when you do it. This is very important.\nStage 3: Introductions. Go around the table and ask everyone to introduce themselves. Start with yourself and the note-taker first. Everyone should state their first name clearly.\nStage 4: Ice-breaker. Ask a warm-up question or ice-breaker. The aim is to allow participants to introduce themselves, ensure everyone understands the procedure, and to encourage people to feel comfortable talking. Previous projects have used photos, cartoons, and media, or asked participants to generate meanings of the terms used in the discussion (e.g., “poor sleep”,”well-being”) to get people talking.\nStage 5: Discussion. This is where you ask your main questions, and follow-up questions. It is a good idea to prepare around five or six main questions, and perhaps highlight three or four that are most important to focus on. The discussion may follow a different order to that on the focus group schedule - this is fine.\nStage 6: Facilitating the discussion. The facilitator should be prepared to help steer conversation back on track, and balance discussion so that everyone gets a chance to contribute. Have a few specific prompts that relate to each question and/or some general prompts to keep the discussion flowing. What are you going to do if no-one participates? Or if one person is contributing? For example… “has anyone else had a similar experience? Does anyone have a different view?” At the same time be ethical and avoid targeting individual people. Give participants the opportunity to describe their interpretations and take ownership. E.g., “How would…make you feel”, “Have you ever noticed that…” “Think back to when…”, “What was most important to you about…?”\nStage 7: Ending the discussion. It’s good to end the discussion by going round the group and asking each participant if they have anything they want to add to the discussion/sum up their thoughts on what was discussed.Remember to allow focus group members the chance to confirm/withdraw consent for their anonymised contributions to be used."

They will be the one asking the questions of the participants, and the one facilitating the discussion. As you are aiming to mimic a naturalistic conversation, you have to build rapport. Ensure you allow everyone time to introduce themselves, and contribute to the ice-breaking phase by saying a bit about yourself.\nA good facilitator shares the perspective of the people they are talking to throughout the focus group. The moderator should not be listening out for good quotes and should not be thinking about what to analyse. The role of the facilitator is to listen to the participants, and understand their points of view.\nNote-taking\nIt is a good idea to have a note-taker there. Hopefully there will be no IT issues that mean that the recording doesn’t work! Therefore, the note-taker should remind the facilitator about recording if required, and note down any impressions/initial thoughts around themes/good quotes. Also, you could note down how well the questions worked - were there any that participants didn’t understand? It should be clear from the recording who is contributing when; it is useful to note down here and there who is speaking at various points, to ensure it matches up later on."

    "text": "3.4 Facilitating focus groups: How to manage the group?\nFocus groups are designed to be an informal discussion in a moderated setting. This allows for the data collection to be flexible and occur in a collective, more natural way - however, moderating a discussion in a group setting can also be challenging. Below we have some top tips for how to manage focus groups.\n\nMake sure your participants are comfortable: establish ground rules and expectations at the start, ensure that you are interested in their perceptions and experiences and that there are no right or wrong answers, start with an ice-breaker to warm your participants up and make sure nobody is put on the spot and participants don’t feel pressured to answer anything they do not wish to answer.\nManage the conversation effectively: make sure all participants have the opportunity to contribute if they wish and one participant doesn’t dominate the whole conversation, ensure that conversation doesn’t stray off topic or get stuck on one topic for too long. Give prompts if the participants struggle to get started on a question.\nStay neutral and listen: be careful not to provide your own opinion or views (this is surprisingly easy to do accidentally!) - this is about your participants and their experiences. Focus on listening to the participants and clarifying/prompting further if needed, give your participants time to gather their thoughts (learn to be comfortable with silent moments and don’t fill them in with your opinions).\n\nView below some situations you may encounter when running a focus group: before checking the answer, have a think how you would manage these scenarios and discuss the answers with your group.\n\nOne/some participants are very quiet and one participant dominates the conversation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ice-breaker/easy opening questions are perhaps most important for quieter members of the group, to help make them feel more comfortable.\n\nIf you are running the focus group online, it might be a good idea to use the Raise hand feature - this would allow quieter members to show that they want to contribute, but without trying to gauge when to jump in the conversation. You can then take points in order of when they raised their hands.\nIf some people have contributed to part of the discussion and others haven’t, open it up to the rest by asking if anyone who hasn’t responded yet has anything to add. However, don’t put people on the spot by asking them directly.\nMake sure to distribute turns equally\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discussion is stuck on one topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemind the members of the group that there are a number of different questions to explore, and that you are mindful of time, so it might be best to leave that topic for now, and you can return if there’s time at the end.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discussion goes off topic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe facilitator has to be mindful of this and be ready to steer the conversation back on topic if needed.\nRemind the members of the group that there are a number of different questions to explore, and that you are mindful of time.\nGently remind participants of the question that was asked. If running the FG online, you may wish to put your questions on the chat or present them with screen sharing so the participants can see the question.\n\n\n\n\n\nParticipants are not comfortable answering the questions in the language the focus group is conducted in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSend questions in advance to your participants so they can prepare\nConsider if the FG could be conducted in a different language (however, be mindful that this creates additional work with transcription and translations and requires the facilitator to be fluent in the language)\nGive participants time to think and answer, and focus on making everybody feel comfortable at the start of the FG.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne participant looks uncomfortable and does not contribute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry to create opportunities for everybody to speak, but remember that you should not point fingers at individual participants\nYou cannot force anybody to speak, and sometimes participants might feel uneasy.\nRemember that they don’t need to answer any of the questions if they don’t want to - it is unethical to force your participants to answer.\n\n\n\n\n\nNobody answers the question you asked\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemember that this is the first time the participants may see the question, and they may need time to gather their thoughts\nConsider sending questions to your participants in advance so they know what to expect.\nDon’t be uncomfortable with a bit of awkward silence (particularly if running your FG online) and don’t fill the space with your opinions - let the participants take the lead.\nPrepare prompts/probes that you can ask to help the participants get started.\nYou can ask if anybody would like to go first (don’t put an individual participant on the spot)\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are not sure what the participant meant/the participant answers very shortly\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuggested Solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can ask if the participant would like to clarify the aspect of the answer you are not sure about.\nYou can ask the participant to elaborate further (they may not want to, which is fine!). If you do this, make sure that you are specific about what you want them to elaborate on (for example, “that’s really interesting, would you want to tell me a little bit more about why you think XXX?)\nIf the participant does not know how to elaborate, you can ask if anybody else wants to add anything. Sometimes this will prompt the participant to build on their answer as a response to what the other participants are saying."

These sessions take a little bit deeper dive into some of the topics and may be particularly useful if you are planning on doing a qualitative dissertation next year.\nWatch the video here\n\n3.7.1 General tips\n\nBe organised - get ethics in early etc., keep track of potential participants\nThink through all the different steps involved as you will need to refer to this in your ethics application - how do you plan to recruit, collect the data, store the data? Before you start collecting data, it would be good to have a checklist with everything you need to consider\nOnly collect the demographics that you need - if you don’t need to know how many siblings they have or what time they go to bed, then don’t ask for that information\nBe sensitive to who your participants are - you might ask different questions in a focus group (where people are in front of others) than you would in an online questionnaire (where it is easier to withdraw if uncomfortable).\nThink about how you keep that data safe/anonymous\nKnow in advance how many participants you need\nKnow how you plan to analyse the data\nConsider what you can do to make the experience as comfortable as possible for participants (e.g. sending out questions in advance is particularly helpful for neurodivergent people/people who do not speak English as a first language).\nFor interviews and focus groups - reassert consent before you start & always remember to press record! Also it’s normal to feel a bt nervous - try to enjoy the process!\nFor all, pilot the questions you ask - make sure that people take from them what you think\nWhen recruiting, think about who your target group is and it’s good to justify why you are looking for a particular demographic. For example, do you definitely require someone to have a particular diagnosis?\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Practicalities of running focus groups\n\nEstablish ground rules - esp. confidentiality\nSet expectations - ask participants to respond to each other rather than each person individually responding to the question (if possible, this is not always the case)\nModerator has to manage the group as best they can\nWrapping things up.\nCan be helpful to have a notetaker to note down anything interesting/if doing it in person, to note down order that people speak in. Allows the moderator to focus on discussion\n\nTricky situations\n\nHow do you develop rapport/make people feel more comfortable?\nHow do you manage tricky dynamics within a group?\nWhat if no-one speaks/one person dominates?\nWhat if people go off topic?\nHow to keep people to time?\nGiving everyone who wants it an opportunity to speak - if online could ask people to raise their hand\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Practicalities of running interviews\nSome of the things that we discussed in focus groups are relevant here, but specifically when thinking about interviews:\n\nTry to develop rapport and make the participant feel comfortable\nTry to focus on the person rather than taking notes - are you giving them encouragement to keep speaking (e.g. nods etc.)?\nIf doing a semi-structured interview, try to notice if the participant brings something up that could/should be followed up with an additional question\nIt’s usual for some interviews to be shorter than others - some people are very concise in how they answer whereas others talk a lot more (and this may be on topic or not)\nBe aware of how someone is presenting - this is less relevant for coursework and more for future projects - if you are doing quite a sensitive topic, it’s good practice to reassert consent and to ask people if they need a break for a little while/if they are okay to continue.\nTry to end on a positive question if you can - it can help to lift the mood for the participant and leave them in a good place\n\n\n\n3.7.4 Practicalities of running qualitative surveys\n\nThink about whether there would be any possibility for the questions to be misinterpreted - you won’t have a chance to correct people if they interpret something wrong (this is where doing a pilot can be useful)\nTry not to have too many questions - what are the key things you want to know? People will be less likely to respond with long, in depth answers if there are a lot of questions to answer.\nIt might be good to give an indication of how many questions they have to go through.\nEasier to keep data anonymous than it is with other forms of data collection above - however still be sensitive to locations, names, personal experiences as these will have to be anonymised."

    "section": "\n2.1 Focus Groups",
    "text": "2.1 Focus Groups\nWhen you are conducting qualitative research, thinking about the questions you are going to ask your participants is really important to ensure your data will be rich and of good quality. You want to write questions that are clear, open-ended and prompt the participants to discuss/share their experiences. Here are ten tips for writing good focus group questions:\n\nEnsure that the questions on your Focus Group Schedule are relevant and allow you to explore and possibly answer your research questions.\nRemember you are not doing quantitative research! The beauty of qualitative research is that your participants can respond in a variety of ways and tell you all about their experiences. In order to allow them to do this, don’t ask them questions, such as: Do people like A more than B? Does one thing cause another?\nMake sure that your questions are open-ended, such as: What are your experiences of… , Can you think of a situation when…? This will keep conversation going. Don’t ask questions that prompt a simple yes/no answer.\nDon’t write questions that are leading e.g. Do you agree that…. You are investigating something you don’t know the answer to. Even if you think you might know the answer your questions should not reflect this.\nThink about ethics! Are the questions you are asking people ethically problematic? If they are, it doesn’t always mean you should not ask them, you just have to be more cautious when you do - it’s important that we respect our participants and give them the opportunity to decide how much they are willing to share!\nThink about time. The focus group is normally around 30-40 mins long. It takes quite a bit of time to get through a focus group schedule, especially if you have to ask additional questions. We would recommend you have 5 or maybe 6 questions/discussion points on your schedule.\nIt is useful to put a star next to/highlight the really important questions you want to ask. This means that if you do start to run out of time then you can miss some of the other questions and go straight to these questions.\nThink about the order of the questions on the schedule. You want to create a discussion that is as natural as possible, and this means one question should follow from the next. If you structure the questions well at this point you may find that in the focus group you have to say very little in order to cover everything.\nHave an opening question that makes people feel relaxed and gets them talking. Something that people can discuss easily and something they don’t need to think about too much.\nAdditional prompts underneath the questions can be helpful for the person running the focus group, especially when you are new to qualitative research. See below for some examples from a study Ashley was involved with a few years ago. So, think of some probing questions that might allow people to discuss the question/topic in more detail. You might not have to use these, but they are there if you do!"

    "text": "2.2 Interviews\nMany of the rules for good focus group questions also apply to interviews (e.g. writing open-ended questions that are not leading, having prompts ready etc.). However, in an interview, the researcher is typically one-on-one with a participant, which means that the discussion may in some cases be a bit less structured than a focus group schedule and may need to include more probes.\nThis is one section from a semi-structured interview schedule Ashley conducted, and is provided purely to give an example of how you might follow up your questions with prompts or probes. Please note that these were sensitive interviews that required NHS ethical approval, and therefore will likely be very different to any research you will be doing during the ODL course in terms of content/tone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions about receiving anxiety interventions\nPROBES\n\n\n\nWhat help have you received for your anxiety?\nWhat help did you receive in the past? Are you currently receiving help? Who helps/helped you?\n\n\nDo you feel as if the help you received (or are receiving) has made any difference to your anxiety? It may have made a positive difference, a negative difference or no difference at all.\nAnything else?\n\n\nWhat was the best thing about the help you received for your anxiety?\nHow did it help? Anything else?\n\n\nWhat was the worst thing about the help you received for your anxiety?\nCan you expand on this?

If so, what changes were made, in your opinion.\nIf there were changes, were they helpful? What helped the most? If any changes at all could have been made, what would your suggestions be?\n\n\nIf someone was to develop an intervention to help adults with ASD with their anxiety, what would help the most, in your opinion?\nWhat would be the best type of intervention?

    "section": "\n2.3 Qualitative surveys",
    "text": "2.3 Qualitative surveys\nMany of the principles discussed above also apply to qualitative survey questions - you want your questions to be clear, qualitative, and open-ended. However, due to the different response format and the fact that you are not there to clarify or provide prompts, there are some additional things to take into account when designing qualitative surveys. Here are some tips for writing good qualitative survey questions:\n\nYou don’t get instant feedback from your participants the same way you do in focus groups or interviews - hence, it’s really important to ensure your questions are clear before starting data collection. Pre-testing the questions with people who are not involved in the project is a good way to do this.\nClarity of the questions is particularly important - make sure there is no ambiguity and keep your questions short.\nAvoid questions which have multiple parts (as participants may just pick up on one) - if your question has multiple parts, it might be better to split it into two\nThink of the order of your questions - if you start with a broad, over-arching question, participants might only answer this question and write “see above” in others, which reduced the richness of your data\nYou can provide examples in brackets after the question that work as “prompts” and help the participant answer the question. However, be careful not to steer them too much or assume what their answer will be. In a recent qualitative survey that Wil conducted, this was one of the questions: “What do you think language barriers in teaching are, and what are your experiences (and/or those of your colleagues) of them in teaching international students? (Here you may want to reflect on your experience of teaching, tutoring, supervising and interacting with international students.)”\nInclude a final open question that allows the participant to share anything they would like to add. For example: “Is there anything else you would like to add about … ?”\nDon’t include too many topic questions - this will reduce the quality of your data as participants will get tired and more likely to drop out (you may have some demographic questions which are shorter and that’s fine)."

This question will result in a numeric answer that does not produce meaningful qualitative data. Be careful not to accidentally ask quantitative questions!\n\nQuestion 2. and 3. These two questions are open-ended and qualitative, and will likely provide rich answers. One thing to think about is what question to start with and where to include prompts - number 3 is quite big and vague, and participants may struggle to get started with this, especially if it’s early on in the FG.\n\nQuestion 4. This is a leading question - it implies that their sense of belonging has indeed improved when this may not be the case. A better way to phrase this would be: “Has your sense of belonging changed since joining a team? If so, how? If not, why not?”\n\n\nQuestion 5. This question puts participants on the spot, which is something you never want to do, especially with a sensitive question like this. Instead, the question should be given to the group, so participants can answer if they want to, and disclose as much or as little they wish to.\n\nQuestion 6. This is a quantitative question and does not provide meaningful qualitative data.\n\nQuestion 7. This is a yes/no-question. You should avoid phrasing questions like this, as they don’t prompt rich answers. Instead, you may want to ask something like: “What has been the best part about joining a team and why? or What aspects of being part of a team do you like? Why? If you ask a yes/no-question, make sure to open it with some prompts (see example above for question 4)."

Alternatively you could ask: “What about this has been challenging to you and how have you managed that?”\n\nQuestion 3: This question doesn’t produce meaningful qualitative data - if they answer “Mostly on weekends”, you don’t have much to analyse. A better way of phrasing the same idea it would be: “How have your experiences of belongingness been?”\n\nQuestion 4: This question also prompts a yes/no answer. This is not necessarily a very good question in the first place because you’re not directly looking at a causal relationship the same way you would in a quantitative study, and it becomes easily a leading question assuming there is a relationship between the two. A better question would be: “How do you think your experiences of belongingness and homesickness compare or connect to each other?”\n\nQuestion 5: This question is a bit ambiguous and it’s not really clear what you are asking - feel better about what? This also assumes that homesickness is always a negative state, which it might not be to the participants. A better way to phrase this would be: “How do you like to manage your feelings of homesickness?” or “What do you do when you are feeling homesick?”"

These sessions take a little bit deeper dive into some of the topics and may be particularly useful if you are planning on doing a qualitative dissertation next year.\nWatch the video here\n\n2.6.1 Overall structure\nIt’s important to think about the overall structure of an interview or focus group schedule. A good structure to use is: A warm up question, the main questions you want to ask, and an exit question. It is likely particularly important to use a warm up/ice breaker question for a focus group, especially if participants don’t know each other particularly well.\nWarm up Question\nThe aim is to allow participants to introduce themselves, ensure everyone understands the procedure, and to encourage people to feel comfortable talking. Previous projects have used photos, cartoons, and media, or asked participants to generate meanings of the terms used in the discussion (e.g., “poor sleep”,”well-being”) to get people talking. What is your idea for an ice breaker that might lead naturally into the main discussion?\nWhat makes a good/poor icebreaker?\nThinking about the points above: What do you think of the following ice-breakers?\n\n\nA FG on lived experience during COVID-19 of international students: What is your favourite meal from your home country?\n\nA FG on coping strategies in students: What do you think is the best way to reduce stress for students?\n\nA FG on feelings of belonging in a work context: What do you think about the graphic below? Does it resonate in any way?\n\n\n\n\n\nBelonging icebreaker\n\n\n\nMain Questions\nBear in mind that the discussion may wander off track or focus on one aspect. Consider which part of the research question you think is most important to get people to answer. Start with this and be prepared to come back to it at the end if you need to. If you have more sensitive questions in your research schedule, they should be included later on, so people answer them when they are more comfortable.\nWhat should the questions be like? Avoid asking questions that ask two or three things in one sentence (e.g., about behaviour and impact on mood). Break it down into simpler questions. Limit the number of direct questions that elicit yes/no answers. These can be useful to gather information but are less helpful in generating a discussion. Add in probes/prompts to elicit further information if required.\nTry to:\n\nFrame questions in an open way that will facilitate discussion (e.g. ‘do you use facebook?’ is closed (can be answered as yes/no) whereas ‘can you tell me about your experiences with social media?’ is a bit more open - you could then follow up with prompts to specifically ask about types if you want to get that information\nFrame questions in a way that is not leading. For example, ‘how did lockdown negatively impact on your ability to study?’ assumes that it did, when this may not be the case. A better question would be ‘’Do you think that lockdown restrictions impacted on students’ experiences of studying? If so, how?”\nIf you have sensitive questions, try to frame questions in a way that is not personal (i.e. you give people a chance to answer related to themselves, but they can also choose not to). This apporach also invites people who may not have lived experience to respond, e.g. “How do you take care of yourself when you are anxious” would be better phrased as “How might students support themselves when they are feeling anxious?” This is more important for focus groups, as people might feel put on thespot and go beyond their comfort levels.\nNot ask lots of different things within the one question, e.g. “Can you tell us about your experiences of studying in Semester 1, how it made you feel and how that affects your studying in Semester 2?” You could ask about experiences of studying generally, and then could follow up with specific sub-questions asking them about semester 1 and 2, if that is something that was important to you.\n\nClosing question\nThe aim here is to give people an opportunity to add anything that might have been missed in the discussion/to wrap things up.\nExamples:\n\nThank you very much for all the great points you had today!Before we wrap things up, you have any final points that you would like to make, that perhaps wasn’t covered in the interview?\nToday we covered X, Y, and Z in the focus group. Is there anyone who has any final thoughts about what we covered here today that they’d like to share?\nThat’s us finished with the main part of the focus group. We’d like to end by giving you all an opportunity to add anything that you think is important but has not been covered in the focus group so far. If you’d like to add something, please press raise hand on teams and we can make sure we go round those people before we finish up!\n\n2.6.2 Braun & Clarke (2013) activity\nHere, we have an adapted version of an interview schedule that is included in the Braun & Clarke (2013) book, on the topic of Partner Relationships. This is purposefully poor. What problems can you spot?\n\nIf you are not already married, are you planning to get married within the next few years?\nI love going to the cinema with my partner, do you?\nDo you have a good time with your partner?\nWould you go to Relate if you had problems in your relationship?\nWhen and how did you meet your partner?\nDo you earn more money that your partner?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me the solution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn general Overall, the interview schedule lacks coherence – it covers a wide range of different topics, and it’s not clear what the focus of the interview is. The ordering of the questions is also very poor (very sensitive questions early in the interview; moving straight from questions about positive aspects of the relationship to relationship difficulties). The researchers should decide on the focus of their research, and their research question, and design the interview schedule with these in mind. The schedule should also be reordered so it starts with less sensitive questions (these should be moved to later in the interview) and the questions flow logically. The interview should also end with a general ‘clean-up’ question (e.g., ‘Is there anything else you would like to add?’). (NB. Our answers to this exercise assume that the research is being conducted in Britain)\nQuestion 1\nProblems First, this is a closed question which does not encourage participants to provide rich and detailed answers. Second, unless the researcher already has quite a bit of information about the participant, it is not an ideal opening interview question because it makes a number of problematic and potentially alienating assumptions, which may damage rapport. For example, unless the study is specifically focused on heterosexual couples (‘partner relationships’ suggests a inclusive focus), or the researcher already knows how the participants identify their sexuality, assuming that people are married, or asking whether they are planning to marry, when marriage is not legally available to same-sex couples, reinforces heteronormativity. Furthermore, unless the research is specifically focused on marriage, asking whether people are ‘planning to get married’ assumes a particular model of relationships whereby marriage (and civil partnership) is treated as the ‘gold standard’ of relationships, the ideal end-point of a couple’s relational journey, and not everyone views marriage in this way (some couples are critical of marriage and choose actively not to get married).\nSolutions The question needs to be reworded so that it is inclusive of same-sex and heterosexual relationships and does not ‘buy into’ assumptions about marriage as gold standard of relationships. The question should also be reworded as an open question and probably moved to later in the interview.\nQuestion 2\nProblems Again, a closed question and extremely leading – it invites the participant to agree with the researcher’s preferences! This is not the best way of accessing participants’ perspectives.\nSolutions Reword the question so that it is open and not leading (do not use the researcher’s preferences in this way).\nQuestion 3\nProblems Again closed, and rather vague (what constitutes a ‘good time’?).\nSolutions Reword the question so that it is open and more concrete.\nQuestion 4\nProblems Again closed, and assumes that the participants know what Relate is (a UK charity that that offers relationship counselling and sex therapy to heterosexual and same-sex couples experiencing relationship difficulties). Making assumptions about what the participants know (and don’t know) can alienate participants (making them feel stupid for not knowing) and damage rapport. Moreover, Relate is not the only provider of relationship counselling in the UK.\nSolutions Replace this with an open question and one that does not make assumptions about the participants’ knowledge (e.g., ‘relationship counselling’ is a good substitute for Relate).\nQuestion 5\nProblems Again, a double-barrelled question and also one that would work better earlier in the interview.\nSolutions Reword the question to remove the double-barrelled element (decide what is more important to know when [how long ago] they met their partner or how they met them?). This would work better as the opening interview question (it makes little sense to ask questions 1-6 before asking this question) because it is a relatively ‘gentle’ question and possibly one that participants would be expecting to answer in an interview on partner relationships. It provides participants with an opportunity to ‘tell the story’ of their current relationship at the start of the interview.\nQuestion 6\nProblems Again a closed question and also a very sensitive one!\nSolutions Again, this needs to be replaced with a more open question that invites detailed responses. The researcher should reflect on what they want to know and how this question relates to their research question.\n\n\n\n\n2.6.3 Further things to consider with qualitative surveys\n\nNo opportunity for clarity, so wording has to be clear\nSimilar points to above in terms of not asking too many different things, having a sensible structure\nNo rapport, unlikely to be an ‘ice breaker’ (although might have an intro question)\nPeople might be more comfortable answering sensitive questions as they can be anonymous\nTry not to have lots of questions as your participants will likely lose patience - what are the key things you want to know?\nCan use branching e.g. in Qualtrics"

We also covered how to do Phases 1 and 2 of the analysis in the Thematic Analysis lecture in Semester 1 Week 11.\n\n4.1.1 Phase 1: Familiarisation (p.42)\n\nTranscribing (or sorting/anonymising your transcript) helps you to become more familiar with your data\nRead over the transcript, but do it in an ‘active’ way. This means reading while searching for meanings and patterns\nNote down anything of interest that comes up, either in a particular part of a transcript or thinking about the overall dataset\n\nPractical steps:\nRead through your transcript and take notes and/or make comments in the margins.

What patterns do you observe?\n\n4.1.2 Phase 2: Generating initial codes (p.59)\n\nCodes identify a feature of the data that seems interesting\nThe process of coding involves going through the transcript and thinking about the data, and picking out what seems interesting/important.\nTry to apply short, specific, labels to each part of the transcript as you go through it.\nCoded data is specific (themes, which come later, are broad) -you will likely end up with quite a lot of different codes.\nCode for as many patterns as you can at this point - it won’t all make it to the next stage, but it’s good if you pick up as much as you can at this stage.\n\nPractical steps:\nInsert labels beside quotes - what is interesting about the quote? What does it tell us in relation to your research question?\n\n4.1.3 How to actually do the coding (logistically)?\nThere are many different ways to approach this - find the way that works for you! There are also different software to conduct thematic analysis (such as NVivo); you are welcome to use these if you wish, but due to the introductory nature of this course we don’t have guidance for using them, so you need to do learn it independently, should you want to use one.\nOption 1: Hand-coding\n\n\n\n\nExample of a hand-coded transcript\n\n\n\nOption 2: Code using Word, by adding comments\n\n\n\n\nExample of a transcript coded using comments on Microsoft Word\n\n\n\nOption 3: Construct a table for your codes and quotes.

    "section": "\n4.2 Developing themes (Phases 3-6)",
    "text": "4.2 Developing themes (Phases 3-6)\nHere, we’ll focus on Phases 3 to 6 of the process. You can find information on each of these phases in the Braun & Clarke (2022) book: Generating Initial Themes (p.78), Developing and Reviewing Themes (p.97), Refining, Defining and Naming Themes (p.108) and Writing up your Analysis (p.118). We also covered how to do Phase 3 in in the lecture for Semester 1 Week 11, while Steps 4-6 were in Semester 1 Week 12. For these activities, you are welcome to do them individually or in pairs/small groups - whichever you prefer!\n\n4.2.1 Phase 3: Generating initial themes (p.78)\n\nIn this stage, you should sort the codes into potential themes. Here, you will start to analyse your codes, and consider how they might share an idea or concept.\nIt might be helpful to visualise this in some way, and see how the codes fit together.\nYou may have codes that don’t seem to fit anywhere, others will fit neatly into themes, others might be in sub-themes\nYou end this step with a collection of candidate themes (and potentially sub-themes)\n\nPractical steps:\n\nStart to group your initial codes together\nCan you see a pattern of shared meaning across different codes?\nWhat are the similarities across codes?\nEnd this stage by collating all the coded quotes relevant to each theme.\nThemes can be descriptive or interpretative (see Braun & Clarke, 2013, Ch 11).\nUsing tables or mind maps at this stage can be helpful\n\n4.2.2 Phase 4: Developing and Reviewing themes (p.97)\nIn Phase 4, you check your themes to see whether they make sense a) when you look at the coded extracts for that theme and b) when you look at the whole dataset.\nChecking the coded extracts\nReviewing at the level of the coded extracts. Read all the collated extracts for a theme…do they form a coherent pattern? Do they tell an important story about shared meaning? Are you sure they are themes rather than topic summaries?\nIf they seem like themes and the coded extracts fit well underneath them, then move on to checking the themes against the dataset.\nIf they don’t, is it the case that a) the theme itself is problematic and needs reworked or b) the theme is fine, but some of the data doesn’t fit?\nChecking themes against the whole dataset\nLook across the entire dataset and consider your theme(s) – do they accurately reflect the meanings in the dataset? Do they tell you about the important patterns that you observed in the dataset?\nPractical steps:\n\nThis involves checking that the themes ‘work’ in relation to both the coded extracts and the full data-set.\nReflect on whether the themes tell a convincing and compelling story about the data, and begin to define the nature of each individual theme, and the relationship between the themes.\nIt may be necessary to collapse two themes together or to split a theme into two or more themes, or to discard the candidate themes altogether and begin again the process of theme development.\nIt may be that your theme is actually a topic summary and needs reworked.\nNot every participant will make specific reference to every theme - that is ok - but think about how each person is represented in the analysis.\nIt can be helpful at this stage to group the relevant quotes together that represent each given theme\n\n4.2.3 Phase 5: Refining, Defining and Naming Themes (p.108)\n\nDuring this phase, you should define and refine the themes.\nDefine and refine = identifying what this theme is about, what aspect of the data is captured by each theme?\nFor each theme, you need to conduct and write a detailed analysis\nIn your report, you will report one theme with sub-themes or two themes (no subthemes) – do they explain different things without overlapping too much?\nTry to choose names for themes that are not one word or likely to indicate topic summaries (see the Semester 1 Week 11 Lecture if you want to revisit this)\n\nPractical steps:\n\nThis involves being able to explain each theme: ‘What story does this theme tell?’ and ‘how does this theme fit into the overall story about the data?’.\nIdentify the ‘essence’ of each theme and construct a concise, punchy and informative name. Usually, you would aim for two themes for the qualitative report\n\n4.2.4 Phase 6: Writing up your Analysis (p.118)\n\nThe analysis should provide a concise, coherent, logical, non- repetitive and interesting account\nThe write up must provide sufficient evidence of the theme(s) (this is where the quotes come in!)\nThe extracts you choose should clearly illustrate the theme\n\nPractical steps:\n\nFor the RM2 qualitative report, you should report either two themes (no subthemes) or one theme with 2-3 sub-themes. This is to allow you to balance depth and breadth.\nAs a rough guide, each theme should include approx. two to five quotes to illustrate it in the write up. Think about which quotes best illustrates your analysis.\nIf you are doing a qualitative dissertation, you will have scope to go further with your analysis; it is a good idea to discuss your data with your supervisor throughout the analytic process.\n\n4.2.5 Activities\n\n4.2.5.1 Activity 1: Try it yourself!\nWe’ve provided the same transcript as for phases 1-2, but it’s a little longer (to give you more scope to develop themes) - you can find it here. You can use the codes you developed last time (adding to them for the additional parts of the transcript), or you can recode the data again if you prefer - either option is fine.\n\nOnce you have your codes, try to organise them into themes.\nGroup together the codes that seem similar in some way - can you think of an overarching ‘theme’ that describes them?\nAre there any codes that don’t ‘fit’ anywhere? (that’s okay if so!)\nCan you identify any quotes that you would use to evidence the themes? Do these definitely match well onto the theme?\n\n4.2.5.2 Activity 2: Bad analysis\nThis is an additional activity and only if you have time/want to delve a bit further. Have a look at the analysis here. This is an example from Braun & Clarke’s book. Why do you think it might be considered a poor example of thematic analysis?\nAfter you’ve finished, you can look at the points that Braun & Clarke identified here. Did you identify any additional ones? Were there any you missed?"

    "text": "4.3 Developing a narrative\nWhen doing your thematic analysis, it is important to develop a narrative and go beyond paraphrasing/summarising your data.\nThematic Analysis requires an active approach from an analyst. It is your role to make sense of the data and to present this in a coherent, understandable and accessible way to the reader. You will take these ‘patterns of meaning’ and make sense of/interpret them, and convey these to the reader.\nOne point to note: Remember that themes do not emerge - this suggests that they are lying in wait for you to discover them, and that the same themes would come up regardless of the analyst. This is not the case - your experiences and interpretations will affect the themes you end up with.\nWhen you present your data in the analysis section, you will have a) your list of themes and b) your quotes. It is your job to combine these with analytical commentary, in order to tell the story of your data. It’s not enough to present the themes and then back these up with quotes - your job is to add in a narrative that brings the themes and the evidence (i.e. quotes) together.\nSemantic and latent analysis\nThematic Analysis allows you to explore semantic or latent themes (or both) in your analysis:\nSemantic: captures explicitly-expressed meaning and stays close to the language of the participants/overt meaning of data, realist. This tends to be somewhat deductive. Semantic approaches still go beyond summarising/paraphrasing.\nLatent: focuses on a deeper, more implicit meaning of the data. What are the underlying meaning, ideas, concepts? This tends to be a bit more inductive.\nThings to be aware of in developing a narrative\n\nRemember to introduce your theme to the reader – what is it about? Don’t start a theme with a quote. If you have sub- themes, still introduce the overall theme briefly before you discuss your first sub-theme\nExplain to the reader why you’ve chosen to include each quote. Why is it important enough to be included? What does it tell us about your data?\nFocus on depth rather than breadth – it is important that we get a real sense of your theme. In the RM2 report you only have 3000 words in total, and so will have to choose what you discuss\nShow the reader who each quote comes from - we should be able to match this up with the demographics table/list of interviews in the Methods section (which then gives us some context). You can do this by using pseudonyms and linking this to the table by using the same names there too.\nThink about where the opportunities are in your data to go beyond description. Is there anything you can infer? If so, remember to be clear with the reader that this is your interpretation. Your reader should be able why you have interpreted the data this way from the quotes you’ve chosen.\n\n\n4.3.1 Activities\n\n4.3.1.1 Activity 1: Semantic vs. latent\nTo explore differences between semantic and latent coding, as well as analysing at an illustrative or analytical level, please read Clarke and Braun (2013) p207-210 and also p252-254.\n\n4.3.1.2 Activity 2: Analysing vs. summarising\nRead pages 8-12 from this thematic analysis on skin-picking. Here, the authors report three themes and then have a reflection at the bottom. Try to identify where the authors have gone beyond paraphrasing - discuss in your groups/pairs if you can.\n\n4.3.1.3 Activity 3: Evaluating analysis and discussion sections\nDo THIS EXERCISE on evaluating analysis sections of published papers."

These sessions take a little bit deeper dive into some of the topics and may be particularly useful if you are planning on doing a qualitative dissertation next year.\nWatch the video here\n\n4.5.1 Thinking about reflexivity\nWe ask you to think about your own position in the research as part of your RM2 report (there is a section in the methods!).\nThis can be quite tricky to do, but is very important for qualitative research. Some suggestions to get you started:\n\nThink about the topic you are doing for your research and your position in it. Where would you place yourself in relation to it? What are your own views on the topic? Do you feel quite strongly about it or not?\nWrite as you reflect. Writing – be it using pen or pencil on paper, typing on a keyboard, dictating to some voice capture device, or some other mode – is an important tool for developing reflexive depth. It is good to do this at various stages of the research process.\nStart with your own experiences, understandings and views, but then also try to interrogate those (i.e. why do you have these particular understandings, views etc.?)\n\nSome questions that you might ask yourself:\n\nWhat do I expect to come up in the data? How does this relate to what we found?\nWhat broader experiences have I had that might influence how I’m thinking about this?\nWhat are my values (i.e. what is important to me)? What about my beliefs? How might these have infuenced my thinking?\nHow might all of these be connected to my identities and the communities I am a part of?\n\n4.5.2 Becoming familiar with the data\nIt’s important to become familiar with the data in the process of doing the analysis. Read through your data and make the following notes:\n\nThings of potential interest\nIdeas that you might want to explore further when you are coding\nYour responses to the data (e.g. how do you feel when you read it?)\n\nTry to unpick any assumptions you have that underpin your initial reactions and observations:\n\nWhat was familiar?\nWhat was unfamiliar/surprising?\nWhy are you reacting to the data in that way?\n\n4.5.3 Activity 1: Read this extract and take familiarisation notes\nRead this extract and take some familiarisation notes for yourself (these are just for you and won’t be shared). We will then go through what Braun & Clarke say about it.\nSome context:\nThis activity is based on a data extract from an interview study exploring LGBT students’ experiences of university life. The participant is a gay man – a mature student, who spoke English as a second language. The extract comes from early in the interview and in response to a question about whether he is ‘out’ as a gay man at university – whether he is openly gay.\nIn this activity (5 mins):\n\nFirst, reflect on your assumptions and expectations about this topic, and your positioning in relation to this topic (are you an insider researcher? Outsider?).\nSecond, read the data extract and make some familiarisation notes.\nBraun and Clarke’s familiarisation notes follow – reflect on similarities and differences in your and their analytic observations and ‘take’ on the data.\n\n\n\n\nAndreas: …I sometimes try to erm not conceal it that’s not the right word but erm let’s say I’m in a in a seminar and somebody- a a man says to me ‘oh look at her’ (Int: mm) I’m not going ‘oh actually I’m gay’ (Int: mm [laughter]) I’ll just go like ‘oh yeah’ (Int: mmhm) you know I won’t fall into the other one and say ‘oh yeah’ (Int: yep) ‘she looks really brilliant’ (Int: yep) but I sorta then and after them you hate myself for it because I I don’t know how this person would react because that person might then either not talk to me anymore or erm might sort of yeah (Int: yep) or next time we met not not sit next to me or that sort of thing (Int: yep) so I think these this back to this question are you out yes but I think wherever you go you always have to start afresh (Int: yep) this sort of li- lifelong process of being courageous in a way or not …\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Braun & Clarke’s familiarisation notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndreas reports a common experience of presumed heterosexuality: coming out is not an obvious option.\nSocial norms dictate a certain response; the presumption of heterosexuality appears dilemmatic, and he colludes in the presumption, but minimally (to avoid social awkwardness).\n\nLooking a bit more deeply, Braun and Clarke speculated that Andreas values honesty and being true to yourself, but he recognises a socio-political context in which that is constrained, and walks a ‘tightrope’ trying to balance his values and the expectations of the context.\n\n\n\n\n4.5.4 Activity 2: A code or a theme?\nIn this activity, we’ll go through a handout that asks you whether something is a code or a theme. Link to the handout is HERE\nFor each label, decide whether it is a code or a theme.\n\nKeep in mind that although there is no absolute distinction between codes and themes, codes tend to have a single facet and capture one insight or observation about the data, whereas themes are ideally multifaceted and capture several insights and observations. Themes should also capture a pattern of shared meaning – this can be shared meaning on the data surface, or shared implicit or underlying meaning.\nReflect on why you have decided that each code/theme is a code or theme. What features of the data, the label/name, and brief explanation of the scope and focus of each code/theme influenced your judgement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Braun & Clarke’s solution\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBraun and Clarke’s suggestions\n\n\n\nThree themes were presented in the analysis: “Two themes capture contradictory ideas: that men’s body hair is natural, and that men’s body hair is unpleasant. A third theme introduces the concept of ‘excess’ hair, which allowed sense-making of this contradiction, mandating men’s grooming of ‘excessive’ hair.” (Terry & Braun, 2016, page 14)\n\n\n\n\n4.5.5 Some common problems with thematic analysis\n\nThematic analysis that fails to address the research question.\nUnconvincing or under-developed analysis: 1) Too many or too few themes 2) Too much overlap between themes or themes are unrelated 3) Themes are vague or not internally consistent or coherent\nLittle or no analytic work has been carried out (for example, using data collection questions as ‘themes’).\nTopic summaries being presented as themes\nMismatch between data and analytic claims (e.g. going beyond what your participants say)\nToo few or too many data extracts (and little or no analytic commentary).\nParaphrasing rather than analysing and interpreting data\nArguing with the data – pointing out the ‘errors’ in a participant’s account.\n\n4.5.6 Strategies for ensuring quality in your analysis\nReflexive journalling\n\nReflect on your experiences throughout the whole research process (not just at the end!)\nThink about your emotional responses to the data\nTry to reflect on your assumptions that you already have about the topic\n\nTalk about your data with others\n\nDiscuss your analysis with other people - it helps to clarify your analytic insights\nDo stages 1-2 in pairs if you want\nDiscuss your findings in groups\nCome along to office hours\nPresent your analysis (even if its preliminary), this can help solidify where we are going with it\n\nGive yourself time\n\nTry not to leave the analysis until the last minute\nGive yourself time to step away and breathe\nPerhaps work on other sections of your report at the same time, so that you have a mental break from analysis\n\nMake sure themes are themes (and be careful when naming them)\nConnelly and Peltzer (2016, p.55): “When a researcher designated a 1-word theme, such as ‘collaboration’, what does that mean in relationship to the experiences of the informants as interpreted by the researcher? Using only 1 word as a theme, there is no way of knowing, for example if the experiences of collaboration were positive or negative, or whether collaboration is important to the nurses. One-word themes do not convey what the researcher found out about collaboration”"

    "title": "5  Ethics, rigour and reflexivity",
    "section": "5.1 Ethics",
    "text": "5.1 Ethics\nThis section will talk you through the ethical considerations you need to conduct qualitative research. As you remember from RM1, every time we conduct research with human participants, we have to think carefully about the potential impact of our research and we must adhere to the BPS Code of Human Research Ethics. Some of the ethical issues are common to both quantitative and qualitative research (for example, informed consent and the right to withdraw), but due to the nature of qualitative data, there are certain aspects we need to be particularly mindful about.\n\n5.1.1 General ethical considerations\nThese are some of the things we MUST take into account when conducting research on human participants:\n\nPossible risks to participants (physical and/or psychological)\nThe elimination or minimization of risks\nJustifying risks in terms of the scientific value of the results\nEthical approval prior to the study\nThe right to withdraw\nInformed consent\nDebriefing and aftercare of participants (especially with deception)\nAnonymity and appropriate data management\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Activity 1: Identify potential ethical issues\nBefore reading on, try to think what ethical issues each of these elements of qualitative research might have:\n\nResearch questions and interview/focus group questions\nData collection\nRecording of interviews/focus group\nAnonymity\nConfidentiality\n\n1. Research questions and interview/FG questions\nThis might look like: In qualitative research, we often ask about someone’s lived experience, or their motivations, or a belief they have. This is quite different to quantitative research where data comes in as numbers and in that sense is less personal.\nWhy might this be an issue: Qualitative research tends to be on topics where we ask people to be vulnerable and open themselves up to us as researchers. If we don’t frame this correctly, our interview schedule might contain questions that are inappropriate and uncomfortable for the participants.\n2. Data collection\nThis might look like: Data collection is much less likely to be anonymous, as typically in-person or online focus groups or interviews are held. Samples are small, and participants may already be known to the researcher.\nWhy might this be an issue: There are possible issues of confidentiality, anonymity (these will be discussed further down) and bias. Our preconceptions might affect the way we frame the questions, how we interact with participants in the focus group, and how we interpret the data.\n3. Recording of focus groups/interviews\nThis might look like: The majority of the time, focus groups and interviews are recorded (either audio + video or audio only). This means that the ‘raw’ data - as it were - is identifiable. In contrast, data for quant studies are often collected anonymously.\nWhy might this be an issue: Data should always be kept safe and secure. However, with qualitative data, there is a real risk that individual people could be identified from a recording of them. This means that dealing with the recordings in a safe and secure way are of utmost importance, and that participants cannot be identified from transcripts.\n4. Anonymity \nThis might look like: In quantitative research, we tend to report summary statistics from groups, and therefore it’d be quite unusual to be able to identify a single participant from the data. With qualitative, it’s a bit different. We collect people’s words and experiences.\nWhy might this be an issue: It is easier to identify someone from the words they use, and the situations and circumstances they describe.\n5. Confidentiality\nThis might look like: In a focus group or interview, people might be very open with us, and tell us things about their life, and the lives of others.\nWhy might this be an issue: We have a duty of care to keep anything that comes out in a focus group/interview confidential (unless they disclose a crime or someone is judged to be at risk). It’s also vital that the rest of the focus group members keep the information confidential too.\nHow would you mitigate these issues?\n\n\n5.1.3 Activity 2: Ethics in published studies\nLook at the methods sections of these studies and try to identify how they have addressed ethical issues\n\nScott et al., 2019\nSutton & Stack, 2013\nRobertson & Simmons, 2015\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Activity 3: Information sheet and constent form\nTake a look at the (slightly modified) Information sheet and Consent form from a qualitative survey study that had ethical approval from the University. Can you identify where and how the principles listed in the General ethical considerations and Activity 1 are discussed?\n\n5.1.4.1 Information sheet\nHow do perceived language barriers affect the teachers’ experience teaching international students in higher education\nInvitation My name is XX, and I am a student at the University of Glasgow. This study is conducted as a part of my MSc Psychological Studies Dissertation project. You are invited to take part in this study because you are currently teaching international students at a UK-based university. Before you decide to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. If you would like further details about the study before deciding whether you want to participate, please get in touch with us via email (XX@student.gla.ac.uk).\nBrief Summary We are looking to learn more about higher education teachers’ perceptions and experiences of language barriers. We are recruiting people who are currently teaching and/or supervising international students in a UK-based university. To understand your experience, opinions and thoughts on this topic, we are conducting the study through an online qualitative survey. Some issues which we are interested in learning more about include: 1) the impact of language barriers on teaching and supporting students who speak English as a second language; 2) how teaching staff perceive language barriers affecting them and their students; 3) possible ways to bridge the language barriers at different levels.\nWhat’s involved if I agree to take part? We want to support you in deciding whether this research study is suited to you - if upon reading this information sheet, you have more questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. If you choose to take part, we will ask you to provide informed consent, after which you will be asked to complete the survey, which consists of two parts: a brief demographic questionnaire, and six open-ended main questions about your experiences of language barriers in your teaching. The survey should take no longer than 40 minutes to complete, and you may take a break at any point if you wish. Because the data will be analysed using qualitative methods, we ask you to provide a comprehensive account of your experiences, but only to provide as much or as little detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Anonymised (see below) quotes from your responses may be used in the dissertation and other future dissemination to illustrate the findings. If you choose to withdraw from the study at any point, you may do so by simply closing your browser.\nConfidentiality: Ways to protect your identity and data We do not want to reveal any personal information about yourself or your colleagues as part of this research. Your responses are recorded completely anonymously through Microsoft Forms and your name will not be recorded anywhere. Prior to the data analysis, all responses will be screened and further anonymised in case you have provided information which may be identifiable (such as specific course names or institutions). We will take the following steps to make sure that your personal information and particular details of your experiences are not shared.\n\nYour data will be assigned an anonymous participant ID automatically and password protected on a secure server\nChanging any names, places or organisations you write in your answers.\nAll the research data will be securely stored to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and only made accessible to future researchers in a form which protects individual, personal information.\n\nWhat are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?  The materials do not involve anything that would affect you in a negative way – as explained above, you may share as much or as little detail about your experiences as you feel comfortable doing. You are also free to withdraw from the research by closing your browser at any point without giving any reason why.\nWho is organising this research? This research is being conducted as part of an MSc Dissertation. The research is supervised by Dr Wilhelmiina Toivo, Wilhelmiina.toivo@glasgow.ac.uk and the research has been granted ethical approval from the University of Glasgow. If you would like further details about the study before deciding whether you want to participate, please get in touch with us via email. Many thanks, XX,\n\n\n5.1.4.2 Consent form\nTitle of Project: How do perceived language barriers affect the teachers’ experience teaching international students in higher education?\nResearcher: XX, (Supervisor Wilhelmiina Toivo)\nIf you agree to participate in this study, then please read the following statements and indicate your consent by ticking the boxes for each statement\n\nI have read the Information Form for participants and so understand the procedures and have been informed about what to expect.\nI agree to participate in this study, which aims to investigate how perceived language barriers affect university teachers’ experiences teaching and interacting with international students who speak English as their foreign language.\nI understand that my participation in this study is voluntary, and that I can withdraw from the study, at any time and for any reason, by closing the browser.\nI understand that my participation in this project is for the purposes of research and is in no way an evaluation of me as an individual.\nI understand that any information given in the investigation will be made and kept anonymous and will remain confidential and no information that identifies me will be made publicly available.\nI understand that anonymous quotes from my responses may be used in academic publications/talks to illustrate the findings.\nI understand that I can contact the researcher for this project by e-mail to receive more information and/or a summary of the results."

Some suggestions to get you started:\n\nThink about the topic you are doing for your research and your position in it. Where would you place yourself in relation to it?\nWhat are your own views on the topic? Do you feel quite strongly about it or not?\n\nWrite as you reflect. Writing – be it using pen or pencil on paper, typing on a keyboard, dictating to some voice capture device, or some other mode – is an important tool for developing reflexive depth. It is good to do this at various stages of the research process.\nStart with your own experiences, understandings and views, but then also try to interrogate those (i.e. why do you have these particular understandings, views etc.?)\nSome questions that you might ask yourself:\n\nWhat do I expect to come up in the data? How does this relate to what we found?\nWhat broader experiences have I had that might influence how I’m thinking about this?\nWhat are my values (i.e. what is important to me)?\nWhat about my beliefs? How might these have influenced my thinking?\n\nHere we have some data from Braun & Clarke - there are different datasets to choose from. If you want to use the ones from Braun & Clarke, you can either choose the ‘childfree’ dataset or the ‘healthy eating’ dataset. However, we know that some topics might be difficult for people, so please do choose a topic of your own preference if you would rather - any qualitative dataset (e.g.from UK Data Service) or news article would be fine.\n\n5.2.1 Activity 1\nSpend about fifteen minutes reflecting on the topic and where you would place yourself in relation to it, both personally and more general views. Write as you reflect. Writing – be it using pen or pencil on paper, typing on a keyboard, dictating to some voice capture device, or some other mode – is an important tool for developing reflexive depth. Start with your own experiences, understandings and views, but then also try to interrogate those.\nAsk yourself questions like:\n\nWhat assumptions am I basing my thinking on?\nWhat broader experiences and values might inform my thinking on this?\nHow might these be connected to myself as a person, my various identities, my personal experience in relation to the topic, and the communities I am part of?\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Activity 2\nDiscuss your experiences of reflecting with your group. Did you find it easier than expected? Was it harder? Was there anything that surprised you about the process? Please only share what you feel comfortable with.\n\n\n5.2.3 Activity 3 (optional)\nAshley has some additional reflexivity probes and tips in her research skills session which can be accessed HERE"

    "section": "\n8.3 Developing a research question",
    "text": "8.3 Developing a research question\nAs part of writing up your qualitative report, we ask that you develop a research question to help you guide your enquiry. Here is some guidance on how to get started:\n\n8.3.1 Getting started with the data\nFor this report, you are using secondary data. This means that the data have already been collected using specific interview questions - before you start thinking about your research question, make sure to have a look at the interview schedule for your chosen dataset (this document will list the interview questions the researchers asked the participants). This should guide you in what questions you might ask and what kind of question you might be able to answer with the available data. You can also take a look at some of the transcripts to get a better feel for the data.\nLooking at the data before you decide on your RQ might feel a bit strange after RM1, but remember that you are not doing hypothesis-testing with qualitative designs - it is quite normal for a qualitative research question to change during the research process, and this is completely fine as you are not statistically testing for a specific effect.\nBe mindful that you are not making a research question that is actually one of the interview questions - your RQ should be broader than what the specific interview questions are.\nOne of the most common mistakes that students make when framing their research question in RM2 is that it is a little too ‘quant’ in nature. This makes perfect sense, as most of your research methods education so far in the programme has been focused on quant! However, for your qual report, your RQ should be a little different to the RQs you are used to.\nLook at the following examples:\n\nHow does poor sleep impact on wellbeing?\nWhat is the difference in wellbeing between those who belong to university and those who don’t?\n\nBoth questions are a bit too quantitative in nature (i.e. 1 is causal and 2 is about a difference between groups). They would also benefit from thinking about what is being looked at, specifically (e.g. views, opinions, experiences).\nWe’d perhaps rephrase these as follows:\n\nWhat are students’ perceptions of the relationship between sleep and wellbeing?\nWhat are online conversion students’ experiences of belonging to University? How do these experiences relate to perceived wellbeing?\n\nThese questions are now a bit more in line with qualitative and are specific about what they are asking in each (and also what the group of interest is). The second one covers a bit more than the first, which is why it is split into two (a main RQ and a subsidiary one)\n\n8.3.2 Some tips for developing a research question\n\n\nCommunication: Keep your research question simple and specific. If you have a very broad question, it can be helpful to break the question down into smaller sub-questions.\n\nType of question: We want the RQ to tap in to more than ‘descriptive’ experience but also offer scope to explore the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of psychological experience–Is the question asking about experiences, understanding, accounts of practice, or influencing factors?\n\n\nPractical constraints: Can the question realistically be explored using thematic analysis and using secondary data? Try not to cover too much\n\nGuiding: Remember that your RQ guides your enquiry but shouldn’t be restrictive - it’s not the case that you are unable to report themes that don’t directly answer your RQ.\n\nFlexibility: Research questions are more flexible than hypotheses-it is acceptable for the focus of the RQ to be refined during/after data collection.\n\n8.3.3 Formative feedback on your RQ\nIf you would like to receive formative feedback on your RQ, you can submit it on this Padlet by the end of week 5, semester 2. Please note that RQs submitted later than that will not receive feedback.\nIf you would like to discuss your RQ, you can also attend Ashley’s and Wil’s office hours."

    "text": "8.4 Qualitative report guide\n\n8.4.1 Using this report guide\nThis guide is intended to help you in the write up of your qualitative project report. When writing your report, remember to use the other resources available to you:\n\nYour feedback for your RM1 report\nBraun & Clarke (2013) have an excellent chapter on writing up qualitative research\nBraun & Clark (2022) book\nAll the resources available in this book (particularly sections for 4. Data analysis and 7. Academic writing)\nPublished articles which use a Thematic Analysis\nA helpful resource for APA formatting is OWL Purdue\n\nUse the assessment criteria on Moodle as a checklist before you submit the report, to ensure you have addressed all points. If you have questions post on Teams and/or visit our office hours. All the best in writing your report.\n\n8.4.2 General writing style\nYour writing should be clear, concise and easy to follow - remember that academic writing does not need to be complicated to be good. Maintain a neutral, academic tone throughout. Discuss one idea/argument per paragraph.\nYou should format your in-text citations and references in APA 7th style.\nAPA writing style encourages the use of active voice (“I coded the data” rather than “the data were coded”) but if you feel more comfortable writing in passive voice, feel free to do so - just make sure to be consistent throughout and be careful not to make your writing overly complex.\nYou can use first person singular (I) or plural (we) but in the reflexivity section make sure to write in first person singular, as this is your reflection of your own positionality to the RQ and the data, and it’s often very personal.\n\n8.4.3 Report sections\nYou should include all the sections listed here:\n\nTitle\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nMethod\nAnalysis\nDiscussion\nReferences\n\n\n8.4.3.1 Title\nThe title should reflect the research question(s) and define your sample (e.g., UG students experience of…). Be specific should include:\n\nWho\nWhat\nHow\n\nExamples:\n\nA Thematic Analysis (how) of the panic attack experiences (what) of primary aged children in inner city Schools in the UK (who)\n\nBarriers and enablers to modifying sleep behaviour (what) in adolescents and young adults (who): A qualitative investigation (how)\n\n\n8.4.3.2 Abstract (suggested word count: 100-150 words)\nIn an academic journal, the function of an abstract is to allow the reader to decide whether or not to read the full article. Aim to summarise all sections of the report in 150 words, including; 1) area of research 2) aim of the study 3) brief methodology, 4) approach to analysis , 5) main findings, and 6) main ‘take-away’/ headline findings and implications. Outline your main themes as findings instead of statistics - as would be typical in a quantitative report. Keep in mind that you are summarising your research for a non-expert and you want to “entice” them to read more.\n\n8.4.3.3 Introduction (suggested word count 750-850 words)\nThe aim of the introduction is to provide the reader with the necessary background to interpret your rationale for further research - this is true whether you are using qualitative or quantitative led enquiry. You are expected to provide a detailed, critical literature review of relevant, published research (quantitative and/or qualitative) for this topic/area. Identify the key issues and debates, and use these to develop an argument for your study. As with any introduction to an APA research report, you should develop the introduction using the’ funnel approach’. You start with a broad overview of the topic and get more and more specific, until you arrive at the rationale for ‘your’ research and of course the research question(s).\nRemember you have a limited number of words to say all of this, so your literature review should focus on relevant and recent articles in the area that have influenced your choice of research question. Do try to locate the most recent examples of qualitative research in this well defined topic area - take the reader to the last example of relevant research and say how you plan to ‘build’ on this research - helping to create a great rationale! Remember to reference all sources of information in the text (for example, government reports, websites, media reports).\nA resource for helping you to develop evaluation in your introductions can be found HERE\n\n\n\n\nBroad-to-narrow structure of an introduction\n\n\n\nYou should end with a statement of what the aim of your study was, and the research question.\nNext, remember to outline any limitations of previous studies - critique (however, make sure the limitations you discuss are actually something your study can address - otherwise your rationale will not be very strong)! Instead of just describing previous studies, try to evaluate them. What do the findings mean? Are there any contrasting findings? If so, why? This should lead clearly to a justification of your own study; how will your study address these issues? This should not be done independently of your literature review. When you are outlining the research and theory you should be developing a clear rationale for your research question.\nFinally, explain your study and clearly outline your research question/s.\nIn sum:\n\nReview and evaluate previous theories and research relevant to the topic.\nProvide a clear justification and explanation of your study, linked to your research questions\nThe main and subsidiary research questions have been outlined clearly and offer good alignment with qualitative methods (in this case a thematic approach).\n\nRemember that the point of this section is exactly the same as a quantitative report: you are demonstrating what work has been done in the past, to build up an argument as to why the current study has been conducted.\n\n8.4.3.4 Method (suggested word count 350-450 words)\nThe aim of the method section is to clearly report how your study was conducted – the reader should be able to re-run your research from the details provided. In this case, contextualise the original study your secondary data are from, report details of the original data collection, explain your process of refining and selecting the data used for your project, and describe the qualitative analysis you used. True ‘replication’ is difficult due to central role of researcher in influencing some aspects of the research such as analysis. This is not an experiment.\nFollow these subheadings for your method section for this report:\nSecondary data\nIn this section you should describe the original study and give the reader context about their data collection. Understanding the specific context of each study is a key element of qualitative research, which is why it is really important for you to explain that in order for your secondary analysis to be reported openly.\nWhat was the original study about? Who conducted it? Where are the data available? You should cite your chosen dataset in APA style (do not provide a link in text) - each dataset has this information on the UK data service page under the Citation and copyright section. How many interviews did they conduct, what was the methodology they used for the interviews (you should find this information on the UK Data Service page for your chosen data set)? Who were their participants? What were the participants asked about?\nIf you have demographic information about the participants on the UK Data Service Website, you may wish to include this, but don’t worry if your chosen dataset doesn’t provide this - we don’t expect you to report any information that was not available to you.\nData selection\nIn this section you should describe your procedure for choosing your final data set. How many interviews did you choose? How did you choose the specific ones you decided to use for your analysis?\nEthics\nThe information you are able to provide in this section will depend on the information made available within the dataset. Some things you might want to comment on include: anonymisation procedures (e.g. has information been replaced or redacted), rapport building, information/consent/debrief, consent as a process. You will only be able to include information that has been made available in the dataset, so do not worry if you do not know a lot of detail.\nReflexivity\nIn qualitative research it is important to acknowledge the role of the researcher in interpretation of the data (Elliot & Fischer & Rennie, 1999). This is where you question your own motives and attitudes in doing this project. Obviously we told you that you had to do it. But what assumptions did you hold prior to beginning the research? Had you considered issues around the topic previously? Did they match what the interviews say? Or did you disagree with them? Did this affect which interviews you chose to include in your analysis? And if so, how did this impact on your analysis? Because different people would interpret the data differently, it is useful for you to expose your own attitudes at this point so that others can see how you have impacted on the analysis. See Braun & Clarke (2013, pp36-37, 303-304) and activities around reflexivity. Reflexive analysis should be concise for this project, perhaps around 3-4 sentences.\nData Analysis\nIn this section, report the following:\n\nDetails on the analysis you are using\nBriefly outline the your theoretical approach (look back at the second part of the lecture in Semester 1 Week 8 for help with this if needed)\nOutline the different stages of the analysis. Qualitative analysis is accused of being fluffy/opaque sometimes. BE SPECIFIC about the stages of analysis. It’s good practice at this stage to refer directly to a methodologists guidelines (e.g. Smith IPA, B and C for TA etc). Literally outline it as STAGE1: STAGE 2: etc. For the project, 2-3 sentences outlining the stages (please note, this is in total, NOT per stage!) is sufficient. A high quality account of the approach to analysis should offer transparency - try to ‘open up the box’ to be clear about what goes on between noting codes and arriving at themes. Remember that the researcher observes themes in the data - they do not emerge\n\n\n8.4.3.5 Analysis (suggested word count: 750-900 words)\nYour analysis section is the part of the project where you show the evidence you have collected. It is similar therefore to a Results Section in a quantitative report. It is useful to use sub-headings here. Each sub-heading will state the name of each theme/sub-theme. You may wish to number these sub-headings.\nThe aim is to make your analysis as transparent as possible, so that anyone can see how you have arrived at your interpretations from your transcript. Quotes and the narrative you develop in this section should be supported using sections taken from the transcript. Start by giving an overview of the main themes in a paragraph (NO QUOTES AT THIS TIME), then present your first themes, inserting supporting quotes at appropriate points.\nLonger quotes should be indented to the centre, separated from the main text by a line before and after,and should include name or number of the participant. Shorter quotes can be embedded in the text (see example below). Guidelines for presenting quotes from participants in APA format can be found HERE.\nPLEASE NOTE: most qualitative analyses require you to provide some analytical commentary after each quote. This addresses the assessment criteria about themes being evidenced by quotes AND described and interpreted within a narrative. See the Semester 2 Week 6 materials on developing a narrative and the Braun & Clarke (2013) text (chapter 11) for examples for analytical commentary.\nSee an example of how to format quotes in APA style HERE\nDue to the word limit we recommend that you:\n\nChoose a maximum of 2 themes to include in the Analysis Section. You may have found more in the analyses, but the scope and word limit of the project allows you to develop a narrative and evidence for 2 main themes with no subthemes. One alternative would be to report one theme with 2-3 subthemes. You may identify more themes than this, which is fine, but please stick to the guidelines here.\nIntroduce and explain each theme briefly using sub headings\nInclude 3-5 quotes support each theme (include the Pseudonym/participant number)\nIf you want to use a quote that is too long – or includes unnecessary detail – you can remove part of the text and replace it with ellipses. However, remember that you should NEVER alter any of the words/phrasing used, even if you think you know what the participant was going to say. This would be the same (and as unacceptable) as editing numbers in a quantitative analysis!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to aim for and avoid in the analysis\n\n\n\nPlease note that, although it says page and line number in the above table, we realise you might not have this information. It is therefore fine just to present the name of the participant for each quote, and you do not need to include page/line numbers too\n\n8.4.3.6 Discussion (suggested word count: 750-850 words)\nSome activities to support you with developing evaluation in your Discussion section can be found HERE.\nThe aim of the discussion is to summarise and explain your overall findings and consider how they help inform the research questions. It will be necessary to consider the findings in relation to previous research and theories (that are referenced in the Introduction). You should also discuss any practical implications of your findings, methodological limitations, and suggestions for further research.\nStart by briefly summarising your RQs and the themes that you have observed. How do your findings add to, or fit with previous research? You can either take each main theme as a big discussion or break it down to sub-theme theme level. Be critical. Bring in the literature you discussed in the introduction, and new literature if need be. Do your findings agree/disagree with previous studies? Do your findings challenge existing research in any way? Did your methodology uncover something that the other studies couldn’t get at? - basically… what is your contribution?\nImplications: In addition to theoretical implications you would normally discuss in a quantitative report in psychology, there is also scope for discussion of the implications. Remember to only discuss implications that you can realistically relate to your own findings, and to support your arguments with evidence. Try to over some specifics and not vague/general implications.\nLimitations: You only used a maximum of three interviews (as we did not want to overload you). However, avoid evaluating your study purely on quantitative standards such as validity and reliability and sample size. We strongly suggest that you do not use lack of generalisation as a limitation. This can be contradictory to the philosophy of the method of analysis. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses on qualitative grounds, e.g., were interviews the best way of eliciting the information for this particular topic? For guidance on evaluating qualitative research against a set of guidelines see Yardley (2000) & Braun & Clarke (2013, Ch 12).\nSuggestions for future research How would you improve on your study? If you had the chance what kind of research questions would you like to ask? Make sure these are also evidence-based and make sense following from your study. Limitations and future directions don’t necessarily need to be separate sections; often, a future suggestion flows logically from a limitation.\nThink of your research project as an apprenticeship. We are not looking for you to do the perfect research project at your first attempt so don’t be shy about pointing out the things you could have done better. But be constructive. It’s not so much about telling us what you did wrong, as telling us what you have learned and how you would improve this study if you got another chance.\nConclusion: End your report with a brief paragraph summarising your key conclusions from the study.\n\n\n\n\nNarrow-to-broad structure of a discussion\n\n\n\n\n8.4.3.7 Recap of word count for each section of the report\n\nABSTRACT: 100-150 words\nINTRODUCTION: 700-800 words\nMETHOD: 350-450 words\nANALYSIS: 750-900 words\nDISCUSSION: 750-850 words\n\n8.4.3.8 References\nReferences both in the main body of text and in the reference list are structured in exactly the same way as in a quantitative report using APA 7th style.\n\n8.4.3.9 Appendices\nAn appendix (plural: appendices) is a supplementary document which forms part of a main document but is not essential for its completeness, containing supporting information, and usually appearing at the end.\nThe appendix can often hold a lot of information. In the qualitative report we ask you to include the following in the appendices of the report:\n\nA list of the interviews you have chosen and a link to the original dataset (you should not include the transcripts themselves)\nA sample of initial coding of the transcript\nYou might also have a list of the interview questions (if easily obtained from your transcripts or study documentation on UK data service)\n\n8.4.3.10 Further reading\nThe RM2 reading list has examples of how qualitative research is presented and written up. The APA Reporting Standards for Qualitative Research provide comprehensive guidance on how to write up a qualitative article. These guidelines are very detailed and go beyond the scope of what you need to report in the qualitative report, but do provide insight into how to report methods and analysis (in particular) in a transparent way. If in doubt consult the guidance on this book chapter, the assessment information sheet for the course and ask on the Teams channel."

    "text": "9.1 General Project questions\nHow do the portfolio and qualitative report work together - should we focus on one before looking at the other? The qualitative portfolio is designed to support you in developing skills that would be important for actually running qualitative studies (e.g. reflexivity, developing questions, awareness of ethics, awareness of good/bad practice for data collection). The report is designed to support you in developing your data analysis skills and then writing up this information into a report.\nRe. the timescales - we would advise that you start working (or at least thinking about) the qualitative report before your qualitative portfolio is handed in. However, we realise everyone is different and prefer to work in different ways. We have developed a timeline for the summative assessment with suggested milestones, although you should revise these deadlines to find something that works for you."

    "title": "9  Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "9.2 Qualitative portfolio questions",
    "text": "9.2 Qualitative portfolio questions\n\n9.2.1 General portfolio questions\nWhere can I find information about the qualitative portfolio? You can find information about the portfolio in the template, the guidelines, the AIS and the video Wil recorded. You can access the materials in chapter 6 of this book.\nWhat is the word count for each section? This is in the template, but it can be broken down as follows: Activity 1a (no word limit for the six questions), Activity 1b (250 words), Activity 2 (250 words), Activity 3 (500 words).\nIn the answers, should we use or avoid acronyms such as BPS and GDPR? Usually in your writing you should avoid unnecessary abbreviations unless they are really commonly used, as this makes it harder for the reader to follow your writing. A good general rule of thumb is not to come up with any abbreviations yourself. These two are very common for the context of your assignment so you can use them (this will also help with the word count which is very limited here).\nDo we need to set out an introduction and concluding summary in our responses to each of the sections? You don’t need this - you can dive straight in :)\nIs it okay for us to take what a study says at face value (i.e. the study says x, which backs up the point)? Or do we have to be critical about the study? Yes, this is fine - we expect you to use the studies to support the points you are making, rather than critically interrogating how well the study supports the claim. It would not really be possible to do the latter within the word count. This assessment is a bit different to when you are writing a report, for example, where you’d want to show how you are building on the existing literature (to help support your rationale)\nI can’t figure out how to cite the BPS code; examples online are both “BPS,2021” and “Oates et al., 2021” Cite it as BPS.\nIs it okay to answer the questions or do we have to make a unique contribution (as you do in an essay or a report)? Just doing what you are asked is fine. This is not the same type of assessment as a report or essay as it is focusing on skills needed to run a project, so it will be assessing different things.\nShould I delete the included instructions from the template document so it’s just the headings for each section? Either keeping them or deleting them is fine - whichever you prefer.\nCan I use guidelines and and strategies for qualitative research from fields other than psychology? Yes, perfectly fine to use these guidelines - you don’t have to stick to Psychology. Just make sure that the guidelines apply to the type of research methodology/RQ you are discussing.\nIs slight variability in word count between the sections allowed as long as the final product is less than 1000? Yes, there is slight variability allowed - it is overall 1000 but you can change the distribution that is suggested slightly (however, try not to change by more than 30-40 words so you provide the right amount of detail for each section).\n\n\n9.2.2 Task 1: Qualitative questions & reflection\nTo what extent can we refine the sample? The RQ refers to ‘students’, but could we specify that further by limiting it to only students who have / not sought out mental health support? Yes, if you want to limit it further, this is fine - we kept it somewhat flexible on purpose so you have a bit of freedom with this.\nWhat sort of evidence is relevant in a reflection? Is it related to the topic (i.e. of mental health) or is it more about the anticipated problems / other researchers protocol in similar research? Or a bit of both? Should we avoid trying to justify our choices in the reflection, or is that a good thing to do? I think it would make sense if it’s more related to methods rather than the topic choice - would be quite good to justify your choices in the reflection.\nWould it be a good idea to include a warm up question/ice breaker and a closing question in our six questions? For the purposes of this assessment, we would suggest just sticking to the six main questions (i.e. not using up two of these for a warm up/exit question). This is because we ask for a limited number, and that way we can keep things consistent across the whole class. One thing you might want to consider is your placement of questions (i.e. the order in which you would ask them).\nWhat is the difference between an interview and a qualitative survey? Interview is where the researcher is one-to-one with a participant and asks them questions. Qualitative survey is a qualitative questionnaire that is often sent to participants online and they fill it out in writing.\nHow does (evidence based) reflection differ (if at all) from (evidence based) writing that we have been doing so far for our assignments? It doesn’t really - we want you to look at the evidence and back up your ideas with relevant sources. The portfolio materials have some probes for your reflection. In the ethics task you should also use the BPS code of ethics and refer to that as well.\nFor activity 1, do we would need to pick a specific topic area (from the evidence base) to explore in more depth in order to frame our questions? The overall topic and research question is given to you in the materials, and then you need to come up with focus group/interview/qualitative survey questions that you would ask the participants to investigate the research question\nShould we mark some of the questions as priority with a star, to note the ones that we would ask first if time was running short in the focus group? You can asterisk the ones you deem most important if you want to, but there is no requirement to do so either (so basically, whichever you prefer)\nCan we include prompts underneath some of the questions? You can if you want, but we ask you to stick to a maximum of one prompt per question if you do this (and that it’s really clear for the reader what the main question is and what the prompt is)\nIs there scope to include visual prompts in our questions? Theoretically yes, although we’ve never seen this asked before so wouldn’t know what a visual prompt would look like. If you want to include this, it might be worth contacting Ashley / Wil to show them an example.\nWhat should we focus our reflection on? About half of the word count in our reflection is currently taken up by an evidence-based discussion of why we opted for the FG format over the interview as this really guided how we constructed the questions thereafter. I just want to know if such a focus is correct or if you’re looking for discussion to centre more around a specific question or two that we chose?\nThere is no one correct way to structure the reflection. We are interested in how you found the experience and why you made the decisions that you did in constructing your list of questions. We often see reflections on why people chose a particular approach for their questions too (e.g. focus group over interview/survey).\nYou have advised that we choose 1 or 2 issues and go into their depth when answering the questions on ethics and the terrible FG. What do you recommend we do for the reflections on the questions in task 1? Do we for instance speak about why we chose a specific approach over the other? Why we chose these specific questions? Challenges we faced etc. Or do we combine everything? Now, we have 250 words of a general reflection on FGs, guideline designing on the topic under discussion, challenges we faced, and what we couldn’t get with citations of course. I’m wondering if we should be more focused and try to answer only 1 point? Basically, we don’t specify what you can and can’t reflect on, so as long as it’s relevant (which this is), then you have some flexibility :) It is a very open question and we are anticipating lots of different ways of answering this one in particular. The main thing is to follow the guidelines that have been given and to look at the ILOs, to see how well you think your response is meeting them\nIs it appropriate to briefly describe our own expertise and experiences, and how they’ve informed our decisions? Would this count as reflexivity and would you like to see evidence of reflexivity? Or would you rather we didn’t talk about ourselves directly? Yes, this would be completely appropriate to discuss as part of reflexivity. It’s fine to discuss yourselves directly (but it is not the only way to do this task). You would be reflecting on why you made the choices you did and would be demonstrating what experiences you have that went into those. Be mindful to make this evidence-based too!\nWe have included a short rationale on why we chose a focus group which is placed before the six questions. Will this short paragraph be included within the word count for the whole portfolio or will it not count as part of the 1000 words? A rationale (if you choose to include it) should be in 1b. The only thing not included in the word count within the activities themselves is the actual questions of Activity 1a\nDo prompts/probes have to be phrased as a question or can they be more of a statement? They will usually be framed as a question but it is fine to write them as a statement for this assignment if you prefer.\nDo we need to define terms such as open-ended questions? No, there isn’t space for this within the word count for this particular assignment\nIf we’re including our group member’s experiences for reflexivity, should we name them, or just refer to them as ‘group member’? You can either use initials or “group member”, either one would be fine\nWithin the questions we are setting for our group project - would it be appropriate to name “University of Glasgow” for instance or would it be best to keep to just “University” in general? We would suggest just sticking to University, rather than specifying the University of Glasgow in particular.\nis it OK to assume that the participants work in the same university as its important for a point we’ve made in the moderating? Yes, this is fine :)\n\n\n9.2.3 Task 2: Ethics\nShould we connect our answer to Question 2 to what we did for Q1? No, there is no expectation that Activity 2 is linked to Activity 1 (although Activites 1a and 1b need to be linked to each other).\nCan you tell us where people tend to go most wrong in this particular question? Sometimes, groups will focus more on ethical issues that are relevant for quantitative research, or research in general, rather than specifically thinking about qualitative research. This is something that is best avoided as it doesn’t answer the question that is set.\n\n\n9.2.4 Task 3: Focus group gone wrong\nFor focus group, do we have to back the issue with specific observations from the video? E.g @ 4.05min X did what, which is an issue because… No, this would likely take up too many words.\nIs there a preference for either moderator or facilitator? No, these are interchangeable and either is fine\nAre we to only quote peer reviewed literature in support of our argument, or can we quote for example from the Braun and Clarke book? No, it’s fine to cite Braun & Clarke and there might also be guides/opinion pieces etc. - these would also be fine to use in support. Also, it’s fine to use older evidence too - we do realise there’s unlikely to be lots of 2022/2023 papers out there on how to do a focus group! We have also included some additional papers on the reading list (under Thinking about the focus group) to give a bit of a start (although please note we haven’t had time to read these…we’ve skimmed through)\nWe have identified the point we want to talk about. For example, it is about the moderator’s part. Should we focus on the moderator’s issue in general or pick a couple of specific examples of bad moderating and write about them in depth? Because the word count is limited, it isn’t apparent what strategy to pursue. Either is fine to be honest. You could pick moderating as one issue and then another one. Or you could focus on two separate parts of moderation. My main suggestion would be to pick an approach that allows you to go into depth on the issue, explaining why it is a problem, what could be improved etc.\nI’m struggling with how to approach the focus group task- do you have any examples excellent or ‘A’ standard work? We don’t provide exemplars, because this assessment is specific so it would be really hard to do that without giving out the answers. In terms of what the focus group task is asking, please make sure you read the ILOs for this assessment that can be found on the AIS document. The only ILO specific for the FG task is:\nCorrectly identify TWO or THREE issues present in the focus group, explain why they are problematic, and discuss possible improvements (#3: Focus group), which means that you should identify what is wrong in how the focus group is conducted (this is mostly based on what the moderator is/isn’t doing), explain why these things are not good when you are conducting a FG, and explain how they could approach this instead.\nTo meet the other ILOs for this task, you should make sure you write clearly and concisely and demonstrate evaluation in your answer (this is an ILO for all your assessments you have done to date and means that you need to use evidence to build your arguments and go beyond description). For this task evaluation should include you explaining why your chosen issues are bad practice when conducting a focus group, and citing some evidence (this will mostly be methodological in nature) to back up your answer.\nFor the focus group task, do we need to include quotes from the transcript when referring to the issues? No, we would advise that you don’t do this, as it will take up a lot of the (very limited!) word count. Instead of quoting, just say what the participant/facilitator did that you think explains the issue you have identified.\nWhen I’m evaluating a study, do you want me to criticise it? Do you want me to talk about the methodology? For this assessment, we aren’t really looking for you to criticise the studies that you are using - for example, for the focus group task, it’s more about explaining why it’s a bad thing that the moderator is doing and then using some evidence to back that up (e.g. some guidance for how to run a focus group or if there’s a paper saying what you might want to do to make your participants feel more comfortable). Here, it’s not about saying ‘here’s this study, it had x participants’ - that is more for the report, where you are building a rationale.\nWould a good structure be: x happened, x is bad for y reason, z should be done instead (with studies to back up)? There are different ways that you can structure it but the above example would be fine. The main thing is that you are covering what we ask of you in the guidance and the ILOs.\nShould we include timestamps of when something happened in the video? No, this is not necessary to include - just telling us what you’ve identified will be fine\nA lot of the literature is pretty old. What should I do? We are aware that some of the literature is older, and it’s completely fine to use this. It’s not the same type of assessment as essays/reports etc., and lot of the guidance is from the 90s or so.\nDo we refer to the participants in the terrible video by their names eg: Ashley, Gaby? Or we call them participant 1, 2, 3, or the moderator (or Wilhelmina) did this with a participant, and that with another participant? I think generally I would say ‘a participant’ etc. as it depersonalises it. However, you do have the names there as they were on the video and - as we haven’t given any guidance specifically on this - it won’t affect the marking in any way if you use our names."

    "title": "9  Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "9.3 Qualitative report questions",
    "text": "9.3 Qualitative report questions\n\n9.3.1 General report questions\nWill there be detailed guidance about each section of the qual report? Yes, we have a guidance in this book in the qualitative report section in chapter 8, which will cover the key points to cover in the report.\nIs our report written in a specific style, e.g. IPA, thematic analysis etc? You will use thematic analysis to analyse your data. We covered this in detail in the lectures in semester 1, and we will also have activities to support this in semester 2.\nHow many interviews should we select for our report? We ask that you choose a maximum of three interviews to analyse (less than this is fine if you have enough data within your chosen interviews)\nI’m not sure what all the different tasks are for the report - where can we find this information? We haven’t shared an explicit task list for the report and one reason for that is because RM2 is purposefully designed to get you to work a bit more independently in preparation for the dissertation.\nKey stages are as follows:\n\nFamiliarise yourself with what is expected for the report assignment have a look at the data and decide which dataset you want to work with\nLook at the data in more detail - which interviews will you select?\nLook at relevant literature and start to think about your RQ think about the rationale for the study\nConduct your Thematic Analysis\nWrite up the study as a full research report (which will be similar to your RM1 report).\n\nFor the report, I am unclear on the criteria for choosing transcripts. I have an approximate idea of a RQ and looking at the transcripts they could be broadly grouped into 2 sets relating to how the participant responds to the questions. Is the intention to choose transcripts that have a consistent thread or that cover a diverse range of views? With only 3 transcripts I’m not sure if it should be based on commonalities or if this is kind of cherry picking? I would say it’s about choosing transcripts that you will be able to analyse and are relevant to the specific research question that you have. So, it would make sense to pick transcripts that are relevant (i.e. they cover the issue you are interested in). They may or may not have the same perspective - I think either would be okay to be honest. Sometimes, it can be useful to have different views as you can then think about why (which can be interesting in terms of evaluation of your themes) and it’s also fine to have more consistent views too.\nCan I do a different analysis and not TA? For the RM2 project we unfortunately only have assessment guidance and support for doing a thematic analysis (Braun &Clarke’s version) and we currently are unable to expand that to different type of analyses - this is because it’s an introductory qualitative course so the same way as in RM1 you were asked to do a specific analysis on the data, we would like you to stick with TA for the individual report.\nWhat voice should I write in? Should my reflexivity be written in first person? APA style encourages the use of active voice instead of passive voice (“I did” instead of “it was done”). You can use either but make sure to be consistent and don’t make your sentences overly complicated. For reflexivity, you should definitely use “I”, because it is about your own reflection in regards to the RQ and the data\nShould I be writing my report as though I designed and conducted the interviews etc myself? You should not write it as if you collected the data - you should write it as a secondary data analysis.\nI’ve found published papers that are using the same dataset and I’m worried that my research is the exact same/doesn’t add anything new? I feel that I should mention these original reports when I’m setting my study in the wider literature, but I’m not sure how then to argue that my study is adding anything new if I acknowledge these reports - what should I do? The chances of your RQ and all other parameters of the study being identical are not very high; if your RQ is worded exactly the same as a published paper, you may wish to tweak it a little bit to focus on a more specific aspect of the data, so you can explain in the introduction how it adds to existing literature. Also look out for what kind of analysis they did - then you can discuss why TA might be better suited for your RQ/the type of data you have. What subsample of interviews did they use and is yours different? If so, why? It doesn’t need to be an entirely different thing to what is already published; good science is built in incremental steps, so think about what are the things that are different in your study to the published papers, and how that adds to what we already know\n\n\n9.3.2 Research questions\nDo you have any tips for how to arrive at your research question for the qualitative report? This book has a section on developing RQs - work through those activities first. I would probably have a look over some of the datasets and decide what you’d like to focus on in terms of topic. Then I’d think about what kind of information you get from them (e.g. is it people’s opinions/experiences/beliefs etc.) and what you’d be interested in looking at specifically.\nShould our questions be broad enough so we can use the whole transcripts or should we narrow them to focus on specfic areas? I think an obvious example to illustrate what I mean would be on the Life limiting transcripts and then having a question of something like “experiences of animals on wellbeing etc” but that would then heavily focus the content of the analysis on one of the sub areas of the transcript and a lot (but not all) might be irrelevant? Perfectly fine to narrow them to focus on specific areas, but with this I would say make sure that you have enough data about your specific RQ to be able to analyse it. You don’t have to use the whole transcript by any means - completely fine to use subsections. It’s possible to revise your RQ in thematic analysis, so - if you were unsure - you could start off broader and then could make it a bit more specific down the line. There is the caveat that this would affect your intro, as you build towards why you’ve chosen this research question in your rationale.\nCan we post more than one RQ on the padlet if we’re not sure what route to go down? Yes, this is fine - you can post a few and we can give feedback on these (let us know if you have a favourite though)\nDoes the research question have to be tailored towards one of the questions asked in the interview or can it be broader? It’s probably better to be broader - generally, themes will tend to be broader than a single question that is asked and it might be a little on the specific side\n\n\n9.3.3 Introduction & Discussion\nShould we include a mini paragraph at the start of the introduction summarising the research question at the end? We would recommend to avoid it for this specific assignment, as this might make it difficult for you to have a broad-to-narrow structure and could cause unnecessary repetition.\nIn the discussion section, can we refer to the data (e.g. the participants) or if that is too detailed for this section?\nTwo of the interviewees I have picked agree on something whilst the other disagrees so was going to specifically refer to this. Or should I be picking up the broader theme that came out in the discussion section and don’t need to reference the specific point I am referring to? In the discussion you should focus on the themes and discuss them in relation to existing literature/future literature instead of focusing on individual comments from your participants (these you should analyse in the analysis section). If you think back to quant, you are not talking about the specific numbers in the discussion but instead focus on what the findings mean and how they build on existing literature. Sometimes in quali literature you see papers that have a sort of combined analysis and discussion section, in which case they might combine individual quotes and existing literature, but for this assignment we are asking you to separate them to two different sections for clarity and to make it a bit simpler for you to structure.\nDo limitations/future directions need to be separate sections? They don’t need to be two separate paragraphs - often what is a limitation to a study can logically be addressed in the next study.\n\n\n9.3.4 Method\nHow to choose my theoretical framework and where does it go?\nI take it that we are meant to indicate if we are using a constructionist or realist/experientialist framework for the analysis. Are we free to choose this or are there any recommendations? I would assume that focusing on semantic themes is more doable given the limited word count? Also, where would we state this? In the methods section or at the start of the analysis? It would be good to explain which theoretical perspective you are coming from, yes. It’s important to take the word limit into account, so it could well be the case that focusing at a semantic level will be more doable - the key thing in your analysis is that you try to go beyond description, and develop a narrative. If you include details about the framework, this should be done in the Methods section, rather than at the start of the analysis.\nIs there an easy guide to working out what theoretical approach you are using? I understand the difference between realism, social constructionism etc in theory but I can’t work out how to apply it to my work. I kind of think it could be any of them so I think I’m missing something! It’s more about thinking about your own perspective (rather than the dataset), as you are correct - any of the different approaches could be applied to the dataset. You could focus on what type of knowledge you are looking for, or instead, think about epistemology/ontology (or both!). It’s sometimes easier to think about the type of knowledge you want to obtain - if it is knowing more about people’s experiences, and how they describe their world, then that would be about seeking out phenomenological knowledge. If it is more in terms of uncovering something concrete that happens in the world (i.e. a truth) then it would be more realist that you are looking for. If you have questions about the theoretical approach specifically, feel free to pop into any of Ashley’s office hours for a chat\nAlso can we draw upon our personal experiences in the report?\nI’m looking at the LGBT+ dataset and also work in an NHS trust; I’ve seen some transphobic actions happen at work and was wondering if this is appropriate to talk about in the report if appropriate for the RQ Yes, there is a section for reflexivity in the methods section, where you should reflect on your experiences and how you felt about the topic/your experiences. You can also expand on it a bit in the discussion if you want.\nAre there good examples we can have a look at for reference in terms of reflexivity?\nI’m looking through the list of examples studies you have included using thematic analysis, and I don’t think they include any form of reflexivity at least not in the method section, or am I missing something? Or would this be done during analysis? Here are some resources to help, but they are not so much examples of reflexivity sections within papers and - instead - are more about giving guidance. Here are some links to start you off:\n\nBarrett et al (2020): How to…be reflexive when conducting qualitative research\nMcLaughlan et al (2012): Phenomenological analysis of patient experiences of medical student teaching encounters (they embedded reflexivity within the ‘Analysis’ section of the methods\nBlog by Jacqui Burne: https://nzareblog.wordpress.com/2017/11/28/self-reflexivity/\nByrne (2022) A worked example of Braun and Clarke’s approach to reflexive thematic analysis\nExamples of reflective commentary from online resources from ’Reflexive Thematic\nAnalysis’ (2022) by Braun & Clarke: https://study.sagepub.com/thematicanalysis/ student-resources/chapter-3/understanding-the-process (this website has a lot of really useful resources - the book is available through the library)\n\nAre we meant to be using literature to support our reflexivity like we did for the group project reflection? You don’t need to do this - reflexivity for a specific research project is more about thinking about your own positionality and how that might have affected the way you approached your data so it doesn’t need to be supported with evidence.\nDo we need to report the specific questions that we used to extract our results? I mean of course I read the full 3 interviews, however my topic was very specific and it was located in two specific questions in the interviews. Do I need to report that? Furthermore do I need to report all the questions of the interview anyways? I see all the qualitative studies report the full set of the questions. You can add them as an appendix but you don’t need to list them all in the methods section; there you can just describe generally what kind of questions they were asked.\n\n\n9.3.5 Analysis\nDo I need to cite literature in my analysis section?\nAccording to Braun and Clarke (2013) a good analysis section will link back to relevant research previously done on the topic (i.e citations to link it to the wider literature) however, I would presume that this will be better suited to the discussion section of our project given the word count? Or should we cite previous research to link our themes within the analysis section? Qual reports are written in one of two ways: 1) where the analysis and discussion are in separate sections - in the analysis, you report your findings, in the discussion, you link your findings to the literature, identify limitations etc. 2) you have a joint analysis and discussion section, where you both present your results and link them to the research. Braun & Clarke are talking about the second, whereas we’re doing the first option. So, no, just focus on presenting your themes in the analysis section - like with the quant report, you will then have a separate Discussion section where you link to the literature\nIn the thematic analysis, what should we do if two participants give opposite answers for the same questions. How do we deal with that conflicts? This can make for a really interesting analysis and discussion section! You should explain the theme for the reader, and provide context for the different views presented by the participants. You can find more information in the Braun & Clarke (2013) book\nIn the interview transcripts came across a nice statement I would like to quote, however the statement was made by the interviewer not the participant. The participant agreed with the interviewers statement. Would it be appropriate to quote the interviewer in this instance? It might depend on what the statement is and the context. So, for example, is it a) the researcher summarising what the participant said and then the participant agreeing or b) the researcher giving their own opinion about it and the participant agreeing? I’d be more likely to say this is okay to include if it was the first than the second, I think. If you were to include it, it would probably be best to a) make sure that there’s enough context surrounding this (i.e. what was there in the lead up to it and also afterwards?), and b) only do this sparingly.\nCan one of my themes be my RQ or an interview question? No, you should try to go a bit deeper in finding meanings in the data in your analysis. If you end up with a theme that is actually your RQ or one of the interview questions, you have summarised the data rather than analysing it. This is surprisingly easy to do by accident so don’t feel bad if this has happened to you - just go back to the data and look a bit further. What aspects of the RQ does the theme capture? What specifically do the participants say about it?\nCan we use a mixture of inductive and deductive approach?\nActually I started exploring the data without any previous thoughts (inductive) and later I started reading the literature for this topic and unintentionally I started observing some of the same conclusions in my data (deductive). Is this a formal way of analysing the data? Can I report a mixture of approaches? It is possible to do this - here is an example of a paper that used a combination of inductive and deductive coding for TA. This would not be the only way to do it, but is an overview of one possible way in which coding and developing themes could utilise both. My main suggestion would be to be clear with the reader in your methods about the thinking behind your approach.\nWhat if in our analysis we end up developing different themes the three interviews? Do we have to report only the common themes or is it ok if we also analyse themes that are evident only in one or two interviews? Ideally at the themes stage you should consider the dataset as a whole so most of your themes should come from more than one interview Try to find quotes which illustrate the theme not just from one participant. Sometimes themes may be more strongly present in parts of the data and that’s ok but try to avoid having one theme that’s from one participant only and another one that’s from another participant - the themes should represent the data a bit more holistically\nWhat if I develop more than two themes - can I mention the other themes in my analysis section? You can briefly say that you developed more themes but don’t waste your word count on explaining them in more detail or talking about the codes related to them. In terms of the discussion, you should focus on the two themes you have chosen and developed a full narrative for (the same way in quant you would not discuss an analysis you did not actually finish) and connect those to existing literature. You can talk about the other stuff as future directions if you would like\nShould the themes be presented in a hierarchical way related with each other? \nWhat if we detect themes that are not related with each other? Do we include data that don’t fit anywhere else or if they are trivial we can exclude them from the final It depends on how you identify your themes - they may be strongly related to each other and hierarchical and they may not. There is no one correct way. In the report writing guide, we ask that you report a maximum of two themes (or one theme with 2-3 subthemes) so I would choose those where you would be able to go into the most depth in terms of interpretation report?"

If you haven’t done so yet, please get in touch with your group now to complete the following activities. We have also provided a checklist of things to complete as a group before the start of semester 2.\n\n6.2.1 Getting organised in groups checklist:\n\nGet in touch with group and make a group chat on Teams\nIntroduce yourselves\nPost group introduction on RM2 channel\nSet up a regular check-in time and/or meeting with group\nDiscuss group agreement and decide together on items to include\nSubmit group agreement to Moodle (individually)\nRead effective group work document and discuss your strengths as a group\nDownload the group work template and assign tasks\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Activity 1: Create a group chat and set up an initial meeting\nGet in touch with your group and create a Teams chat. You MUST use Teams for all communication about the group project. Do not use any other platforms (such as Whatsapp, WeChat, Facebook etc.) as these can lead to people being excluded. Set up a meeting in which you will discuss Activity 3 from this chapter. After the initial meeting, set up a regular check-in time. This doesn’t necessarily need to be a meeting every time, you can also do it over text. You will need to coordinate between time zones/work calendars/other responsibilities\nDO: Communicate regularly and be clear about where and how you are going to communicate about the group project. Be proactive if you are having a busy time and let your group know.\nDON’T: Disappear and stop talking to your group if you’re having a hard time (if something happens and you don’t feel comfortable sharing with your group, you can let the course leads know). Don’t agree to meeting times that don’t suit you.\n\n\n6.2.3 Activity 2: Introductions\nIntroduce yourself to your group members on your Teams chat. In your introduction, tell your group where you are based, which parts of the degree you have enjoyed the most up to date and what is your favourite R function. As a group, find one non-psychology/university related thing that you all have in common and share that on the RM2 Teams channel in the thread. Bonus points for the most random common thing!\n\n\n6.2.4 Activity 3: Group agreements\nWe appreciate that group work can be challenging (and even more so if you are spread all over the World!) and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. We also ask that you complete a task allocation and upload this with your agreement (they are in the same template). The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and some rules that each of the group members is committed to. It also means that the group begins working with clearly allocated roles and tasks. This is not to mean that you cannot change tasks later, but it is helpful to set expectations from the outset.\nDownload the group agreement template from HERE.\nThen look at the list of potential items to include below, and as a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list. You will be able to find a sample list of tasks to include for the task allocation in Appendix 1 within the template.\nWork on a collaborative document on OneDrive to create your group work agreement and task allocation, and once the group is happy with their agreement and initial tasks, each group member should submit it to Moodle individually (on the Formative Activities tile). Please submit your group agreement by the end of week 14 of semester 1. If you haven’t submitted your agreements and task allocation, we will be in touch to check up on your group.\nGroup agreement items\nHere is a list of items you may want to discuss with your group and add to the group agreement:\n\nWe all agree to establish a common timeline for the project and discuss any deviations from the timeline together as a group\nWe all agree to communicate with each other openly and honestly about the project and get in touch with the course leads in the event of an unsolvable group conflict.\nWe all agree to respect each other’s individual ways of working and discuss these openly as a group.\nWe all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks.\nWe agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.\nI agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group. If I am struggling and I do not feel comfortable sharing that with the group, I will get in touch with the course/programme leads for support\nWe all agree to meet on a regular basis as established by the group. If I cannot make a meeting I agree to communicate this openly with my group and get in touch to catch up about things I have missed.\nWe agree to plan out the individual contribution of each team member in advance before group work starting and openly communicate any changes that may arise during the project.\nWe agree to establish the best method of communication for our group that’s inclusive and takes into account everybody’s individual needs.\n\n\n\n6.2.5 Activity 4: Read the Effective Group work document\nThis document can be used as a checklist to do the group work for your qualitative portfolio. Give it a read and then discuss it with your group once you have your initial meeting. The effective group work guide can be found HERE\n\n\n6.2.6 Activity 5: Group work planner (optional)\nYou can access the planner template HERE. We advise, although do not require, that you make one for your group, discuss the tasks together and assign them to members of your group. This is a good way to keep track of who is allocated to a task, and to modify tasks as required over the course of your project.\nWork back from the deadline to establish tasks and when they need to be done. Discuss your strengths and what each person in the group would like to do."

Below, you will find information and the required materials to complete each task. Please use THIS TEMPLATE to complete your submission.\n\n6.3.1 Task 1a: Qualitative questions\nBelow, you will find a brief overview of a study topic. In this task, we would like you to imagine that you are collecting data for this qualitative study. A variety of different data collection methods are possible (e.g. interview, focus group, open-ended survey questions). Thinking about the topic and research question presented below, please develop SIX questions that you would ask your participants to gather data on the topic of interest. Your questions should be open-ended, clear, concise and appropriate, and the order that they are presented in should make sense. Your aim is to develop questions that would be likely to generate open discussion and rich responses from participants.\nPlease note: This section (1a) does not contribute towards the 1000 word count for the assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy overview\n\n\n\nUniversities provide support for students, and this support can come in many forms, from free counselling services to well-being advisors (Raunic & Xenos, 2008).\nIn one study, it was reported that only 3% of students used their university counselling service, and only 5% of those who were characterised as vulnerable based on questionnaire scores, used the services (Cooke et al., 2006). This suggests that the majority of students did not make use of services available.\nThere are many reasons why students may not choose to seek help, including being unaware of services, low socio-economic status, being from different cultural background, embarrassment about having to seek help, and scepticism about the services (Eisenberg et al., 2007; Gulliver et al., 2010).\nAnother issue around seeking support is that many who do chose to get help, have to wait long periods for appointments (Mowbray et al., 2006). In a recent article reported in the Independent, a waiting time of 4 months was cited for some universities. These delays to support, can lead to emergence of mental health crises situations. Unfortunately, in this the University of Glasgow had one of the longest wait times for counselling (Buchan, 2018).\nResearch question: What are student’s views on how universities can support students and their mental health needs?\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Task 1b: Qualitative questions reflection\nFor task 1B, please reflect on your experience of generating the questions in task 1A. Do you think they would achieve what you want to achieve? Why or why not? Was it easier or harder than you expected? Please link to the evidence base in your answer (suggested word count: 250 words)\n\n\n6.3.3 Task 2: Ethics\nWith the Open Science movement, the use of Open, secondary datasets has become a more popular way of conducting research. You’ve learnt about the importance of Open data in terms of reproducibility and replicability for quantitative research in RM1 - however, the benefits and challenges of Open data are quite different in qualitative research and there are a number of ethical issues associated with sharing qualitative research data openly. For task 2 of your portfolio, we would like you to identify one ethical issue associated with the sharing and/or use of open qualitative data, and discuss why it is an issue, and how it could be mitigated. In your response, you should cite relevant literature on the use of open qualitative data, as well as the BPS code of Ethics (suggested word count 250 words)\n\n\n6.3.4 Task 3: Focus group gone wrong\nHere is a short video from a fictional focus group that is conducted very badly (please note this video is created only for the purposes of this assessment, is not from a real focus group, and should not be shared outside of this course!).\nYour task is to identify two or three issues with how the focus group is run and discuss why they are problematic and outline possible ways to improve them. In your response, you should cite relevant literature to support your ideas.\nAccess the Focus Group gone wrong recording HERE\n\n\n6.3.5 Where to get guidance for the portfolio tasks?\nYou should make sure you are up to date on Ashley’s lectures on qualitative research. Further, some of the chapters in this book have activities and information which will be helpful in completing the portfolio:\n\nChapter 2 on Qualitative questions\nChapter 3 on Data collection\nChapter 5 on Ethics"

    "text": "7.1 Evaluation in introductions\nThe activities in this section are designed to help you improve your evaluation in the introduction of your RM2 report (and your dissertation). To re-cap from RM1, the purpose of your introduction is to provide a rationale for your study and answer the WHY question; why is your study worth doing? You want to sell your idea to the reader, using existing literature to show how you are building on the evidence that is there.\nThings to do and things to avoid\n\nAvoid doing one study per paragraph – instead, build your arguments using multiple sources\nAvoid describing previous studies in a lot of detail – instead, show how your study builds on them\nAvoid critiques that your study cannot answer - instead, focus on aspects that your study will address\nJust because something is never done before, doesn’t make it worth doing; show with evidence why we should do the study.\n\nHere are paragraphs from an imaginary introduction to a qualitative study investigating postgraduate students’ confidence in their zombie apocalypse survival.\nFor each, you can click on them to have a look in depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 1: Using one source, writing descriptively\n\n\n\n\n\nA study by Lane and Karin (2011) looked at zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students. The sample consisted of 25 participants (20 male and 5 female), recruited through convenience sampling. The study employed involved a survey comprising Likert-scale questions designed to measure participants’ self-assessed confidence in various survival skills. Additionally, participants were asked about their exposure to zombie-related media. The data were subjected to t-tests and regression analyses, and the authors’ found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse confidence was exposure to zombie-themed video games.\nThis paragraph uses just one source, and describes the study in a lot of detail. Instead, it would be better to synthesise evidence from multiple studies and focus on what the findings mean, rather than being descriptive about the studies. Something like:\nA study by Lane and Karin (2011) found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students was exposure to zombie-themed video games. Miller and Williams (2023) had similar findings, but exposure to zombie films was also a significant predictor of confidence. This suggests that simulation through media is an effective way to increase self-efficacy towards an unknown threat, which has also been found with alien attack research (Ripley, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 2: Making criticisms that are outwith the scope of your study\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the majority of studies on zombie apocalypse survival confidence have looked at samples that consist of mostly men (Lane & Karin, 2011 but see also Grimes & Dixon, 2019), and that previous samples have been small.\nThis paragraph makes a criticism that the study cannot address - issues with sample size are not something that we can address with qualitative designs.\nInstead, to create a stronger rationale, it would be better to focus your critical evaluation on aspects which your study actually builds on:\nWhile evidence on the behavioural predictors of zombie apocalypse confidence is robust, the majority of research (see Anderson, 2014) has focused on the exposure time to media and survival skills training. Hence, we lack understanding of how participants perceive their confidence beyond simulation experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 3: Why is your study worth doing?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo date, there has been only one qualitative study on the topic – Seok (2013) collected data through semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis and two themes, “Survival mode” and “Confidence through skills” were identified. This study looked at undergraduate students; there is no previous literature on postgraduate students’ perceptions of their apocalyptic confidence. Therefore, this qualitative study investigates the perceived confidence of postgraduate students in their abilities to survive a zombie apocalypse.\nJust because it’s never been looked at doesn’t automatically mean it should be - show with evidence why and how you would expect your new sample/method/something else about the study to differ from previous research and why it’s worth exploring:\nPrevious research has looked at undergraduate students; however, it has been suggested that postgraduate students would be the group most at risk during a zombie apocalypse (Williams, 2021), but also that apocalyptic self-efficacy decreases with age (Anderson, 2004). This suggests that postgraduate students are the most mentally and physically vulnerable group during a zombie apocalypse, and hence it is important to understand their perceptions of apocalypse confidence, and the lack of thereof.\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1 Activity 1: RM1 feedback\nGo back to your feedback from RM1 and see what your marker has said about the evaluation ILO and comments for your introduction. List two things that you did well, and two things you want to improve for RM2. If you would like to discuss the feedback and possible improvement points further, you can pop to Wil’s or Ashley’s office hours.\nQuite often what we see is students engaging with a lot of literature in the intro (which is good!), but not really building a rationale or explaining with evidence why the study is worth doing. We want you to move beyond describing the research to critically evaluating it to show how your study expands on existing knowledge.\n\n\n7.1.2 Activity 2: Top tips and rationales in published papers\nTip 1: Show how your study builds on existing literature When you are building your rationale, try to use multiple studies to show your reader what the current context of the literature is, and how your study is expanding that knowledge. What new is your study bringing? How is it expanding on existing studies?\nIf you look at these paragraphs from Robertson et al. (2018), they are building the rationale for their study by showing how it expands on existing literature:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a rationale\n\n\n\n“Kerns and Kendall (2012) published an updated review of the prevalence of anxiety in individuals with ASD, and all studies fell within White et al. (2009)’s original range for anxiety symptoms (11–84%). It should be noted that, of the 24 studies included in the review, only two reported data for individuals older than 19 years of age (Bakken et al., 2010, Hofvander et al., 2009), which illustrates the need to also focus on adults with ASD in future research (Howlin, 2000).”\n“Secondly, as far as we are aware, there have been no qualitative studies investigating anxiety in autism using semi-structured interviews. Although focus groups and interviews are both good data collection methods for qualitative data, there is evidence that individual interviews tend to elicit a broader range of discussion points (Guest, Namey, Taylor, Eley, & McKenna, 2017). Again, this further extends the previous investigation conducted by Trembath et al. (2012).”\n\n\nTip 2: Focus your criticism\nWhen you are critically evaluating studies in your introduction, make your criticism focused on things that your study is addressing. This helps you build the rationale. For example, for the RM2 report, don’t focus on the sample size and generalisability of existing studies in your introduction, because these are not things that your study will actually be able to address. Instead, focus on gaps/problems your study can address.\nIf you look at this paragraph from Toivo & Scheepers (2019), they are identifying a gap/problem in existing literature and showing how the new study is addressing this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing cricitism\n\n\n\n“A potential issue in the above SCR studies (as well as in some of the cognitive studies discussed earlier) is that the stimuli were not very tightly controlled in terms of lexical variables (length, frequency, abstractness, etc.), or in terms of syntactic/pragmatic complexity when multi-word phrases were used. This, again, introduces a number of potential confounds (both within and across languages), making it difficult to separate effects of emotional resonance from those related to cognitive effort in word processing. In the present study, we aimed at eliminating such potential confounds by matching our stimuli on a number of lexical variables–as was done in the ERP studies discussed above [22, 23]–and by avoiding the use of translation equivalents.”\n\n\nTip 3: Draw arguments from related topics. \nSometimes if your topic has not been studied much, it might be difficult to create an evidence-based rationale for your research question. In this case, you can draw logical parallels from related topics/domains. Remember to explain to the reader why you would expect the findings to generalise across the related topics.\nIf you look at this paragraph from Mahrholz et al. (2018), it acknowledges that evidence on what they are looking at is scarce in voice perception, but the same effect has been found in face perception:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing arguments from other topics\n\n\n\n“Similarly, looking at reliability of personality traits across presentation durations, Willis and Todorov [40] found that ratings of trustworthiness, competence, likeability, aggressiveness, and attractiveness for faces, showed moderate to strong positive correlations after 100 ms, 500 ms, and 1000 ms, when compared to ratings made without time constraints. Only participants’ confidence in their own judgements increased as a function of duration. Likewise, again using photographs of faces, Bar et al. [33] reported medium positive correlations between ratings at 39 ms and 1700 ms. The authors indicated that the lower threshold was sufficient for reliable assessments of threat but not intelligence, supporting the theory that rapid first impressions serve as a mean of self-preservation and help determine appropriate approach-avoidance behaviour [1, 33, 38]. The idea being that it should not require much information to decide whether a stranger is friend or foe. Finally, Todorov and colleagues [39] obtained a similar finding, again for faces, showing 33 ms of exposure to be sufficient to distinguish between trustworthy- and untrustworthy-looking stimuli. Whilst correlations with control ratings improved between 33 ms and 100 ms, increased exposure duration did not significantly increase the correlations.\nIn voice research, though there are limited studies that consider the reliability of personality judgements across varying lengths of stimulus types, similar findings have been shown as in face research.”\n\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Activity 3: Active reading\nWhen you are reading journal articles, make sure to take notes and think of how each article can be used to build your rationale in the introduction. Here is a resource you can use to help structure your notes about the studies you are going to use for your introduction: INTRODUCTION NOTES DOCUMENT"

You may have already completed this as a part of your Data analysis chapter, but if you haven’t please do it now. We ask you to compare two published papers against some of the qualitative report ILOs. You can access the activity HERE\n\n\n7.2.2 Activity 2: Going deeper in your analysis\nOne of the characteristics of a strong analysis section is that the writer demonstrates an ability to go beyond paraphrasing/summarising. This activity is designed to help you understand what might be involved in doing so.\nRead the following two extracts from an Analysis section and discuss these questions:\n\nWhich of the two examples is better? Why?\nWhat have the authors done that makes the analysis better?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract 1 - from a study about the impact of the COVID pandemic\n\n\n\nSarah spoke of using her leisure time to plan and fantasise about her wedding:\n“it’s enough of a fantasy… it’s meant to be stressful, but it’s really just been fun. It’s like such a nice break from this humdrum life we’re living in right now” (Sarah: lines 459-461).\nOrganising a significant life event seems to be viewed as granting Sarah an escape from her current monotony. While she refers to it as a “fantasy”, potentially given uncertainty of the pandemic’s progression, she appears to perceive this as constructive and realistic for her future self. Alternately, Mandy’s leisure activity involved impossible daydreams:\n“I started daydreaming more ridiculous stuff… I know it’s never going to come true ’cause it’s not real, but it still entertains me” (Mandy: lines 443-444)\nWhile Mandy seems to be under no illusion that her daydreams are feasible, daydreaming impossible scenarios appears to provide more of a release than realistic situations that are subject to ever changing government regulations (e.g. travel bans) that may fall through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract 2 - from a study about social media use during the pandemic\n\n\n\nSome participants said it was difficult to fall asleep at night, including those who knew they should fall asleep but could not (“if I can’t stay up and can’t sleep”- Sarah), or participants subjectively thought that they did not need sleep or did not want to fall asleep (“I am not really able to sleep at night, or like, sleep isn’t really needed.” -Andrew)\nParticipants said that they used social media but that it was only positive at certain points:\nI feel like TikTok was fun in the first lockdown during the summer,’cause of all this summer content I guess, but after that it really went downhill. I don’t know like, OK personally I deleted all my apps about three weeks ago (John)\nJohn tells us here that he deleted all his apps, because they all went ‘downhill’. Tik Tok was helpful during the first lockdown, but not after it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1 (COVID):\nThis is the better example, because it goes beyond paraphrasing. The researcher is analysing the quotes and have engaged with the meaning behind the words. Each quote is selected in a way that helps the author build a narrative of what is happening in the data\nExample 2 (sleep): This is the weaker example, because the author just paraphrases what the participants say. This ends up not adding any real value in terms of analysis, because the reader could just read the quote. The narrative needs to analyse the data and show the reader why they interpret something in a particular way."

    "text": "7.3 Evaluation in discussions\nIn this section, we aim to provide some guidance about how to go beyond description in your writing. We will specifically focus on the Discussion section for your RM2 qualitative report here, but you can apply this to other types of writing. In particular, it should be helpful for you as you proceed to your dissertation.\n\n7.3.1 What were your findings?\nIn your discussion section, start off by telling us what you found in your analysis. However, the key thing to think about here, in terms of evaluation, is to relate your findings to the wider research. It will be likely a good idea to consider on a theme by theme basis (if you are doing themes with no sub-themes) or on a subtheme basis (if you have one theme with 2-3 subthemes).\nSome things to consider:\n\nWhat did you find? What was your specific contribution?\nThinking about your findings, what are the similarities and differences from other research findings/theory? Why might this be the case?\nSituate your findings within the broader context - tell the reader about why your findings are important. This can help a reader understand the importance of the results.\nDo your findings challenge existing research? If so, in what way?\nCan you bring in any critical thinking?\n\n\n7.3.1.1 Activity 1\nRead the paragraphs below (from Crompton et al., 2020) and think about what the authors are communicating, with a view to considering the points above.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nHow the authors summarised their results\nThe contribution of the themes to the evidence base\nHow the authors discuss their results in relation to existing research\nHow the authors relate their findings to theory\nHow the authors link the findings to ‘broader issues’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 1: Crompton et al., 2020\n\n\n\nThis study aimed to examine the experiences of autistic adults spending time with autistic and non-autistic family and friends using a thematic analysis framework. Social relationships are an important, though often complicated, part of autistic people’s lives. Previous research has tended to focus on autistic people’s relationships with (assumed) non-autistic friends and family. Here, we specifically contrasted relationships across and within neurotypes. The analysis revealed three themes: cross-neurotype understanding, minority status and belonging. The themes help us understand why relationships between autistic and non-autistic people might be so challenging, and how relationships between autistic people are different.\nThe results align with previous research on the challenges that autistic people face when interacting with non-autistic others, but highlight that interactions with other autistic people are fundamentally different. All participants reported that spending time with non-autistic family and friends involved specific difficulties, which were not experienced when interacting with other autistic friends and family. This aligns with the double-empathy theory of autism which suggests that autistic and non-autistic people have a mutual difficulty in understanding and empathising with one another due to differences in how each person understands and experiences the world, rather than because of a communicative deficit on the part of the autistic person (Milton, 2012). Neurotypical people have been shown to overestimate how ego-centric their autistic family members are (Heasman & Gillespie, 2018), and overestimate how helpful they are to autistic people (Heasman & Gillespie, 2019). Our findings suggest that this translates into real-world difficulties in interactions with neurotypical friends and family that may affect the mental health, well-being and self-esteem of autistic people.\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 What are the implications of the study?\nIn addition to theoretical implications you would discuss in a quantitative study, there is scope to discuss broader implications here. Try not to go too far in these implications (e.g. saying that the NHS/University could make changes to how they run mental health services…this would require a much more extensive body of work).\nSome things to consider:\n\nHow could these findings be applied to real-life situations?\nWhat impact might this have for society in the future (even if with the caveat that it would depend on future research)?\nCan you back up your assertions with reference to the literature? Arguments here are much stronger if you are able to cite papers to support.\n\n\n7.3.2.1 Activity 2\nRead the paragraph below from Robertson et al. (2018) and think about how the authors have communicated the implications of the research.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nWhat the implications of the research are\nHow the authors link the findings to practical suggestions\nHow the authors back up these suggestions to the existing literature base\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 2: Robertson et al., 2018\n\n\n\nThere are a number of potential clinical applications for the findings detailed in this paper. They echo the modifications that are already undertaken for anxiety interventions designed for children and adolescents with ASD (Walters, Loades, & Russell, 2016). For example, it may be important to include support for individuals undertaking an intervention for their anxiety. This has already been identified as helpful in anxiety management interventions for children with ASD (Sofronoff et al., 2005), but the evidence here suggests that this might also be the case for adults. Furthermore, as adults reported feeling that they enjoyed interacting with other autistic people, it would be important to test whether running autism-only groups in terms of anxiety interventions helps outcomes or other aspects related to the feasibility of anxiety management programs (e.g. retention of participants).\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.3 Limitations\nAll research will have limitations - there is never going to be a perfect study. Research is about weighing up the options and choosing the best design for the specific question we want to answer. Remember that qualitative research is not automatically limited because it is not quantitative. Therefore, be very careful not to use criteria we have for quantitative studies (e.g. generalisability, reliability, small sample sizes) and apply them to qualitative studies. Doing so would be similar to critiquing a behavioural study for not asking participants about their experience of interacting with the stimuli ;)\nSome things to consider:\n\nDo you think the quality, source, or types of data (or the analytic process) might have affected the methodological integrity in some way? If so, how?\nRemember to link your limitations to the evidence base. This makes your argument much stronger than if you do not cite to back your points up.\nIf you want to mention generalisability, perhaps consider the concept of transferability instead, which is much more relevant to qualitative.\nTry to aim for depth rather than breadth here - it’s much stronger to have two points addressed comprehensively than have 12 limitations, each covered in a single sentence (you don’t want to make your discussion section a limitations-fest!).\n\n\n7.3.3.1 Activity 3\nRead the paragraph below from Toivo & Scheepers (2019). Although this is not a qualitative paper, the following paragraph exhibits many of the strengths noted above.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nWhat was the limitation observed?\nHow do the authors discuss this limitation, and consider the effect it might have had?\nHow do the authors back up their arguments with evidence from the literature base?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 3: Toivo et al., 2019\n\n\n\nOne concern might be that we did not explicitly control for L2 proficiency in our sample of bilinguals, which is likely to affect cognitive effort in processing L2. However, all of our bilingual participants (a) self-reported to be highly proficient in English, (b) were Glasgow University students using English as their language of study, and (c) had been living in an English-speaking country for minimum of three months (average: two years and four months) when the study was conducted. Together with the fact that post-trial word recognition rates were well above 90% across participant groups and conditions (Fig 2), we do not believe that variation in L2 proficiency was large enough to have a major impact on our results. That said, we agree that proficiency should ideally be controlled for in future research, e.g. by adding a suitable measure as another person-specific covariate in the analyses. Previous research had identified proficiency as a potential mediating factor of perceived emotionality in the Bilingualism and Emotions Questionnaire [50], and it had also been suggested that bilinguals with close-to-native proficiency in L2 show similar affective processing in L1 and L2 [19].\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.4 Anything else?\nThe points above are the key components that we would expect to see in a Discussion section, with some guidance on how to go beyond description. However, you might also consider strengths and future research. It’s also good to include a brief conclusion. You won’t have the word count available to go into the same detail as in these papers, so try to use the examples above to really focus on what you can incorporate within your Discussion section to strengthen your evaluative writing."

    "title": "6  Ethics, rigour and reflexivity",
    "section": "6.1 Ethics",
    "text": "6.1 Ethics\nThis section will talk you through the ethical considerations you need to conduct qualitative research. As you remember from RM1, every time we conduct research with human participants, we have to think carefully about the potential impact of our research and we must adhere to the BPS Code of Human Research Ethics. Some of the ethical issues are common to both quantitative and qualitative research (for example, informed consent and the right to withdraw), but due to the nature of qualitative data, there are certain aspects we need to be particularly mindful about.\n\n6.1.1 General ethical considerations\nThese are some of the things we MUST take into account when conducting research on human participants:\n\nPossible risks to participants (physical and/or psychological)\nThe elimination or minimization of risks\nJustifying risks in terms of the scientific value of the results\nEthical approval prior to the study\nThe right to withdraw\nInformed consent\nDebriefing and aftercare of participants (especially with deception)\nAnonymity and appropriate data management\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Activity 1: Identify potential ethical issues\nBefore reading on, try to think what ethical issues each of these elements of qualitative research might have:\n\nResearch questions and interview/focus group questions\nData collection\nRecording of interviews/focus group\nAnonymity\nConfidentiality\n\n1. Research questions and interview/FG questions\nThis might look like: In qualitative research, we often ask about someone’s lived experience, or their motivations, or a belief they have. This is quite different to quantitative research where data comes in as numbers and in that sense is less personal.\nWhy might this be an issue: Qualitative research tends to be on topics where we ask people to be vulnerable and open themselves up to us as researchers. If we don’t frame this correctly, our interview schedule might contain questions that are inappropriate and uncomfortable for the participants.\n2. Data collection\nThis might look like: Data collection is much less likely to be anonymous, as typically in-person or online focus groups or interviews are held. Samples are small, and participants may already be known to the researcher.\nWhy might this be an issue: There are possible issues of confidentiality, anonymity (these will be discussed further down) and bias. Our preconceptions might affect the way we frame the questions, how we interact with participants in the focus group, and how we interpret the data.\n3. Recording of focus groups/interviews\nThis might look like: The majority of the time, focus groups and interviews are recorded (either audio + video or audio only). This means that the ‘raw’ data - as it were - is identifiable. In contrast, data for quant studies are often collected anonymously.\nWhy might this be an issue: Data should always be kept safe and secure. However, with qualitative data, there is a real risk that individual people could be identified from a recording of them. This means that dealing with the recordings in a safe and secure way are of utmost importance, and that participants cannot be identified from transcripts.\n4. Anonymity \nThis might look like: In quantitative research, we tend to report summary statistics from groups, and therefore it’d be quite unusual to be able to identify a single participant from the data. With qualitative, it’s a bit different. We collect people’s words and experiences.\nWhy might this be an issue: It is easier to identify someone from the words they use, and the situations and circumstances they describe.\n5. Confidentiality\nThis might look like: In a focus group or interview, people might be very open with us, and tell us things about their life, and the lives of others.\nWhy might this be an issue: We have a duty of care to keep anything that comes out in a focus group/interview confidential (unless they disclose a crime or someone is judged to be at risk). It’s also vital that the rest of the focus group members keep the information confidential too.\nHow would you mitigate these issues?\n\n\n6.1.3 Activity 2: Ethics in published studies\nLook at the methods sections of these studies and try to identify how they have addressed ethical issues\n\nScott et al., 2019\nSutton & Stack, 2013\nRobertson & Simmons, 2015\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Activity 3: Information sheet and constent form\nTake a look at the (slightly modified) Information sheet and Consent form from a qualitative survey study that had ethical approval from the University. Can you identify where and how the principles listed in the General ethical considerations and Activity 1 are discussed?\n\n6.1.4.1 Information sheet\nHow do perceived language barriers affect the teachers’ experience teaching international students in higher education\nInvitation My name is XX, and I am a student at the University of Glasgow. This study is conducted as a part of my MSc Psychological Studies Dissertation project. You are invited to take part in this study because you are currently teaching international students at a UK-based university. Before you decide to take part, it is important for you to understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take time to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. If you would like further details about the study before deciding whether you want to participate, please get in touch with us via email (XX@student.gla.ac.uk).\nBrief Summary We are looking to learn more about higher education teachers’ perceptions and experiences of language barriers. We are recruiting people who are currently teaching and/or supervising international students in a UK-based university. To understand your experience, opinions and thoughts on this topic, we are conducting the study through an online qualitative survey. Some issues which we are interested in learning more about include: 1) the impact of language barriers on teaching and supporting students who speak English as a second language; 2) how teaching staff perceive language barriers affecting them and their students; 3) possible ways to bridge the language barriers at different levels.\nWhat’s involved if I agree to take part? We want to support you in deciding whether this research study is suited to you - if upon reading this information sheet, you have more questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. If you choose to take part, we will ask you to provide informed consent, after which you will be asked to complete the survey, which consists of two parts: a brief demographic questionnaire, and six open-ended main questions about your experiences of language barriers in your teaching. The survey should take no longer than 40 minutes to complete, and you may take a break at any point if you wish. Because the data will be analysed using qualitative methods, we ask you to provide a comprehensive account of your experiences, but only to provide as much or as little detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Anonymised (see below) quotes from your responses may be used in the dissertation and other future dissemination to illustrate the findings. If you choose to withdraw from the study at any point, you may do so by simply closing your browser.\nConfidentiality: Ways to protect your identity and data We do not want to reveal any personal information about yourself or your colleagues as part of this research. Your responses are recorded completely anonymously through Microsoft Forms and your name will not be recorded anywhere. Prior to the data analysis, all responses will be screened and further anonymised in case you have provided information which may be identifiable (such as specific course names or institutions). We will take the following steps to make sure that your personal information and particular details of your experiences are not shared.\n\nYour data will be assigned an anonymous participant ID automatically and password protected on a secure server\nChanging any names, places or organisations you write in your answers.\nAll the research data will be securely stored to comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (2018) and only made accessible to future researchers in a form which protects individual, personal information.\n\nWhat are the possible disadvantages and risks of taking part?  The materials do not involve anything that would affect you in a negative way – as explained above, you may share as much or as little detail about your experiences as you feel comfortable doing. You are also free to withdraw from the research by closing your browser at any point without giving any reason why.\nWho is organising this research? This research is being conducted as part of an MSc Dissertation. The research is supervised by Dr Wilhelmiina Toivo, Wilhelmiina.toivo@glasgow.ac.uk and the research has been granted ethical approval from the University of Glasgow. If you would like further details about the study before deciding whether you want to participate, please get in touch with us via email. Many thanks, XX,\n\n\n6.1.4.2 Consent form\nTitle of Project: How do perceived language barriers affect the teachers’ experience teaching international students in higher education?\nResearcher: XX, (Supervisor Wilhelmiina Toivo)\nIf you agree to participate in this study, then please read the following statements and indicate your consent by ticking the boxes for each statement\n\nI have read the Information Form for participants and so understand the procedures and have been informed about what to expect.\nI agree to participate in this study, which aims to investigate how perceived language barriers affect university teachers’ experiences teaching and interacting with international students who speak English as their foreign language.\nI understand that my participation in this study is voluntary, and that I can withdraw from the study, at any time and for any reason, by closing the browser.\nI understand that my participation in this project is for the purposes of research and is in no way an evaluation of me as an individual.\nI understand that any information given in the investigation will be made and kept anonymous and will remain confidential and no information that identifies me will be made publicly available.\nI understand that anonymous quotes from my responses may be used in academic publications/talks to illustrate the findings.\nI understand that I can contact the researcher for this project by e-mail to receive more information and/or a summary of the results."

Some suggestions to get you started:\n\nThink about the topic you are doing for your research and your position in it. Where would you place yourself in relation to it?\nWhat are your own views on the topic? Do you feel quite strongly about it or not?\n\nWrite as you reflect. Writing – be it using pen or pencil on paper, typing on a keyboard, dictating to some voice capture device, or some other mode – is an important tool for developing reflexive depth. It is good to do this at various stages of the research process.\nStart with your own experiences, understandings and views, but then also try to interrogate those (i.e. why do you have these particular understandings, views etc.?)\nSome questions that you might ask yourself:\n\nWhat do I expect to come up in the data? How does this relate to what we found?\nWhat broader experiences have I had that might influence how I’m thinking about this?\nWhat are my values (i.e. what is important to me)?\nWhat about my beliefs? How might these have influenced my thinking?\n\nHere we have some data from Braun & Clarke - there are different datasets to choose from. If you want to use the ones from Braun & Clarke, you can either choose the ‘childfree’ dataset or the ‘healthy eating’ dataset. However, we know that some topics might be difficult for people, so please do choose a topic of your own preference if you would rather - any qualitative dataset (e.g.from UK Data Service) or news article would be fine.\n\n6.2.1 Activity 1\nSpend about fifteen minutes reflecting on the topic and where you would place yourself in relation to it, both personally and more general views. Write as you reflect. Writing – be it using pen or pencil on paper, typing on a keyboard, dictating to some voice capture device, or some other mode – is an important tool for developing reflexive depth. Start with your own experiences, understandings and views, but then also try to interrogate those.\nAsk yourself questions like:\n\nWhat assumptions am I basing my thinking on?\nWhat broader experiences and values might inform my thinking on this?\nHow might these be connected to myself as a person, my various identities, my personal experience in relation to the topic, and the communities I am part of?\n\n\n\n6.2.2 Activity 2\nDiscuss your experiences of reflecting with your group. Did you find it easier than expected? Was it harder? Was there anything that surprised you about the process? Please only share what you feel comfortable with.\n\n\n6.2.3 Activity 3 (optional)\nAshley has some additional reflexivity probes and tips in her research skills session which can be accessed HERE"

If you haven’t done so yet, please get in touch with your group now to complete the following activities. We have also provided a checklist of things to complete as a group before the start of semester 2.\n\n7.2.1 Getting organised in groups checklist:\n\nGet in touch with group and make a group chat on Teams\nIntroduce yourselves\nPost group introduction on RM2 channel\nSet up a regular check-in time and/or meeting with group\nDiscuss group agreement and decide together on items to include\nSubmit group agreement to Moodle (individually)\nRead effective group work document and discuss your strengths as a group\nDownload the group work template and assign tasks\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Activity 1: Create a group chat and set up an initial meeting\nGet in touch with your group and create a Teams chat. You MUST use Teams for all communication about the group project. Do not use any other platforms (such as Whatsapp, WeChat, Facebook etc.) as these can lead to people being excluded. Set up a meeting in which you will discuss Activity 3 from this chapter. After the initial meeting, set up a regular check-in time. This doesn’t necessarily need to be a meeting every time, you can also do it over text. You will need to coordinate between time zones/work calendars/other responsibilities\nDO: Communicate regularly and be clear about where and how you are going to communicate about the group project. Be proactive if you are having a busy time and let your group know.\nDON’T: Disappear and stop talking to your group if you’re having a hard time (if something happens and you don’t feel comfortable sharing with your group, you can let the course leads know). Don’t agree to meeting times that don’t suit you.\n\n\n7.2.3 Activity 2: Introductions\nIntroduce yourself to your group members on your Teams chat. In your introduction, tell your group where you are based, which parts of the degree you have enjoyed the most up to date and what is your favourite R function. As a group, find one non-psychology/university related thing that you all have in common and share that on the RM2 Teams channel in the thread. Bonus points for the most random common thing!\n\n\n7.2.4 Activity 3: Group agreements\nWe appreciate that group work can be challenging (and even more so if you are spread all over the World!) and we want to support you to have an enjoyable and educational group work experience. To that end, we would like each group to create a group agreement that all members sign. We also ask that you complete a task allocation and upload this with your agreement (they are in the same template). The purpose of this is for the group to come together and establish common ground and some rules that each of the group members is committed to. It also means that the group begins working with clearly allocated roles and tasks. This is not to mean that you cannot change tasks later, but it is helpful to set expectations from the outset.\nDownload the group agreement template from HERE.\nThen look at the list of potential items to include below, and as a group, discuss which items you want to include in addition to the standard ones provided, and if there are any you would like to edit or add outside of this list. You will be able to find a sample list of tasks to include for the task allocation in Appendix 1 within the template.\nWork on a collaborative document on OneDrive to create your group work agreement and task allocation, and once the group is happy with their agreement and initial tasks, each group member should submit it to Moodle individually (on the Formative Activities tile). Please submit your group agreement by the end of week 14 of semester 1. If you haven’t submitted your agreements and task allocation, we will be in touch to check up on your group.\nGroup agreement items\nHere is a list of items you may want to discuss with your group and add to the group agreement:\n\nWe all agree to establish a common timeline for the project and discuss any deviations from the timeline together as a group\nWe all agree to communicate with each other openly and honestly about the project and get in touch with the course leads in the event of an unsolvable group conflict.\nWe all agree to respect each other’s individual ways of working and discuss these openly as a group.\nWe all agree to respect diversity in our group. This includes cultural differences, neurodiversity, different work/life situations and may manifest in different ways of working/approaching tasks.\nWe agree to discuss our strengths as a group and divide tasks accordingly.\nI agree to stay in touch with the group and communicate as established by the group. If I am struggling and I do not feel comfortable sharing that with the group, I will get in touch with the course/programme leads for support\nWe all agree to meet on a regular basis as established by the group. If I cannot make a meeting I agree to communicate this openly with my group and get in touch to catch up about things I have missed.\nWe agree to plan out the individual contribution of each team member in advance before group work starting and openly communicate any changes that may arise during the project.\nWe agree to establish the best method of communication for our group that’s inclusive and takes into account everybody’s individual needs.\n\n\n\n7.2.5 Activity 4: Read the Effective Group work document\nThis document can be used as a checklist to do the group work for your qualitative portfolio. Give it a read and then discuss it with your group once you have your initial meeting. The effective group work guide can be found HERE\n\n\n7.2.6 Activity 5: Group work planner (optional)\nYou can access the planner template HERE. We advise, although do not require, that you make one for your group, discuss the tasks together and assign them to members of your group. This is a good way to keep track of who is allocated to a task, and to modify tasks as required over the course of your project.\nWork back from the deadline to establish tasks and when they need to be done. Discuss your strengths and what each person in the group would like to do."

In this task, we would like you to imagine that you are collecting data for this qualitative study. A variety of different data collection methods are possible (e.g. interview, focus group, open-ended survey questions). Thinking about the topic and research question presented below, please develop SIX questions that you would ask your participants to gather data on the topic of interest. Your questions should be open-ended, clear, concise and appropriate, and the order that they are presented in should make sense. Your aim is to develop questions that would be likely to generate open discussion and rich responses from participants.\nPlease note: This section (1a) does not contribute towards the 1000 word count for the assessment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy overview\n\n\n\nUniversities provide support for students, and this support can come in many forms, from free counselling services to well-being advisors (Raunic & Xenos, 2008).\nIn one study, it was reported that only 3% of students used their university counselling service, and only 5% of those who were characterised as vulnerable based on questionnaire scores, used the services (Cooke et al., 2006). This suggests that the majority of students did not make use of services available.\nThere are many reasons why students may not choose to seek help, including being unaware of services, low socio-economic status, being from different cultural background, embarrassment about having to seek help, and scepticism about the services (Eisenberg et al., 2007; Gulliver et al., 2010).\nAnother issue around seeking support is that many who do chose to get help, have to wait long periods for appointments (Mowbray et al., 2006). In a recent article reported in the Independent, a waiting time of 4 months was cited for some universities. These delays to support, can lead to emergence of mental health crises situations. Unfortunately, in this the University of Glasgow had one of the longest wait times for counselling (Buchan, 2018).\nResearch question: What are student’s views on how universities can support students and their mental health needs?\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 Task 1b: Qualitative questions reflection\nFor task 1B, please reflect on your experience of generating the questions in task 1A. Do you think they would achieve what you want to achieve? Why or why not? Was it easier or harder than you expected? Please link to the evidence base in your answer (suggested word count: 250 words)\n\n\n7.3.3 Task 2: Ethics\nWith the Open Science movement, the use of Open, secondary datasets has become a more popular way of conducting research. You’ve learnt about the importance of Open data in terms of reproducibility and replicability for quantitative research in RM1 - however, the benefits and challenges of Open data are quite different in qualitative research and there are a number of ethical issues associated with sharing qualitative research data openly. For task 2 of your portfolio, we would like you to identify one ethical issue associated with the sharing and/or use of open qualitative data, and discuss why it is an issue, and how it could be mitigated. In your response, you should cite relevant literature on the use of open qualitative data, as well as the BPS code of Ethics (suggested word count 250 words)\n\n\n7.3.4 Task 3: Focus group gone wrong\nHere is a short video from a fictional focus group that is conducted very badly (please note this video is created only for the purposes of this assessment, is not from a real focus group, and should not be shared outside of this course!).\nYour task is to identify two or three issues with how the focus group is run and discuss why they are problematic and outline possible ways to improve them. In your response, you should cite relevant literature to support your ideas.\nAccess the Focus Group gone wrong recording HERE\n\n\n7.3.5 Where to get guidance for the portfolio tasks?\nYou should make sure you are up to date on Ashley’s lectures on qualitative research. Further, some of the chapters in this book have activities and information which will be helpful in completing the portfolio:\n\nChapter 2 on Qualitative questions\nChapter 3 on Data collection\nChapter 5 on Ethics"

    "text": "8.1 Evaluation in introductions\nThe activities in this section are designed to help you improve your evaluation in the introduction of your RM2 report (and your dissertation). To re-cap from RM1, the purpose of your introduction is to provide a rationale for your study and answer the WHY question; why is your study worth doing? You want to sell your idea to the reader, using existing literature to show how you are building on the evidence that is there.\nThings to do and things to avoid\n\nAvoid doing one study per paragraph – instead, build your arguments using multiple sources\nAvoid describing previous studies in a lot of detail – instead, show how your study builds on them\nAvoid critiques that your study cannot answer - instead, focus on aspects that your study will address\nJust because something is never done before, doesn’t make it worth doing; show with evidence why we should do the study.\n\nHere are paragraphs from an imaginary introduction to a qualitative study investigating postgraduate students’ confidence in their zombie apocalypse survival.\nFor each, you can click on them to have a look in depth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 1: Using one source, writing descriptively\n\n\n\n\n\nA study by Lane and Karin (2011) looked at zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students. The sample consisted of 25 participants (20 male and 5 female), recruited through convenience sampling. The study employed involved a survey comprising Likert-scale questions designed to measure participants’ self-assessed confidence in various survival skills. Additionally, participants were asked about their exposure to zombie-related media. The data were subjected to t-tests and regression analyses, and the authors’ found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse confidence was exposure to zombie-themed video games.\nThis paragraph uses just one source, and describes the study in a lot of detail. Instead, it would be better to synthesise evidence from multiple studies and focus on what the findings mean, rather than being descriptive about the studies. Something like:\nA study by Lane and Karin (2011) found that the biggest predictor of zombie apocalypse survival confidence levels in undergraduate students was exposure to zombie-themed video games. Miller and Williams (2023) had similar findings, but exposure to zombie films was also a significant predictor of confidence. This suggests that simulation through media is an effective way to increase self-efficacy towards an unknown threat, which has also been found with alien attack research (Ripley, 2017).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 2: Making criticisms that are outwith the scope of your study\n\n\n\n\n\nIt should be noted that the majority of studies on zombie apocalypse survival confidence have looked at samples that consist of mostly men (Lane & Karin, 2011 but see also Grimes & Dixon, 2019), and that previous samples have been small.\nThis paragraph makes a criticism that the study cannot address - issues with sample size are not something that we can address with qualitative designs.\nInstead, to create a stronger rationale, it would be better to focus your critical evaluation on aspects which your study actually builds on:\nWhile evidence on the behavioural predictors of zombie apocalypse confidence is robust, the majority of research (see Anderson, 2014) has focused on the exposure time to media and survival skills training. Hence, we lack understanding of how participants perceive their confidence beyond simulation experiences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me Example 3: Why is your study worth doing?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo date, there has been only one qualitative study on the topic – Seok (2013) collected data through semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using thematic analysis and two themes, “Survival mode” and “Confidence through skills” were identified. This study looked at undergraduate students; there is no previous literature on postgraduate students’ perceptions of their apocalyptic confidence. Therefore, this qualitative study investigates the perceived confidence of postgraduate students in their abilities to survive a zombie apocalypse.\nJust because it’s never been looked at doesn’t automatically mean it should be - show with evidence why and how you would expect your new sample/method/something else about the study to differ from previous research and why it’s worth exploring:\nPrevious research has looked at undergraduate students; however, it has been suggested that postgraduate students would be the group most at risk during a zombie apocalypse (Williams, 2021), but also that apocalyptic self-efficacy decreases with age (Anderson, 2004). This suggests that postgraduate students are the most mentally and physically vulnerable group during a zombie apocalypse, and hence it is important to understand their perceptions of apocalypse confidence, and the lack of thereof.\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1 Activity 1: RM1 feedback\nGo back to your feedback from RM1 and see what your marker has said about the evaluation ILO and comments for your introduction. List two things that you did well, and two things you want to improve for RM2. If you would like to discuss the feedback and possible improvement points further, you can pop to Wil’s or Ashley’s office hours.\nQuite often what we see is students engaging with a lot of literature in the intro (which is good!), but not really building a rationale or explaining with evidence why the study is worth doing. We want you to move beyond describing the research to critically evaluating it to show how your study expands on existing knowledge.\n\n\n8.1.2 Activity 2: Top tips and rationales in published papers\nTip 1: Show how your study builds on existing literature When you are building your rationale, try to use multiple studies to show your reader what the current context of the literature is, and how your study is expanding that knowledge. What new is your study bringing? How is it expanding on existing studies?\nIf you look at these paragraphs from Robertson et al. (2018), they are building the rationale for their study by showing how it expands on existing literature:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a rationale\n\n\n\n“Kerns and Kendall (2012) published an updated review of the prevalence of anxiety in individuals with ASD, and all studies fell within White et al. (2009)’s original range for anxiety symptoms (11–84%). It should be noted that, of the 24 studies included in the review, only two reported data for individuals older than 19 years of age (Bakken et al., 2010, Hofvander et al., 2009), which illustrates the need to also focus on adults with ASD in future research (Howlin, 2000).”\n“Secondly, as far as we are aware, there have been no qualitative studies investigating anxiety in autism using semi-structured interviews. Although focus groups and interviews are both good data collection methods for qualitative data, there is evidence that individual interviews tend to elicit a broader range of discussion points (Guest, Namey, Taylor, Eley, & McKenna, 2017). Again, this further extends the previous investigation conducted by Trembath et al. (2012).”\n\n\nTip 2: Focus your criticism\nWhen you are critically evaluating studies in your introduction, make your criticism focused on things that your study is addressing. This helps you build the rationale. For example, for the RM2 report, don’t focus on the sample size and generalisability of existing studies in your introduction, because these are not things that your study will actually be able to address. Instead, focus on gaps/problems your study can address.\nIf you look at this paragraph from Toivo & Scheepers (2019), they are identifying a gap/problem in existing literature and showing how the new study is addressing this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing cricitism\n\n\n\n“A potential issue in the above SCR studies (as well as in some of the cognitive studies discussed earlier) is that the stimuli were not very tightly controlled in terms of lexical variables (length, frequency, abstractness, etc.), or in terms of syntactic/pragmatic complexity when multi-word phrases were used. This, again, introduces a number of potential confounds (both within and across languages), making it difficult to separate effects of emotional resonance from those related to cognitive effort in word processing. In the present study, we aimed at eliminating such potential confounds by matching our stimuli on a number of lexical variables–as was done in the ERP studies discussed above [22, 23]–and by avoiding the use of translation equivalents.”\n\n\nTip 3: Draw arguments from related topics. \nSometimes if your topic has not been studied much, it might be difficult to create an evidence-based rationale for your research question. In this case, you can draw logical parallels from related topics/domains. Remember to explain to the reader why you would expect the findings to generalise across the related topics.\nIf you look at this paragraph from Mahrholz et al. (2018), it acknowledges that evidence on what they are looking at is scarce in voice perception, but the same effect has been found in face perception:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrawing arguments from other topics\n\n\n\n“Similarly, looking at reliability of personality traits across presentation durations, Willis and Todorov [40] found that ratings of trustworthiness, competence, likeability, aggressiveness, and attractiveness for faces, showed moderate to strong positive correlations after 100 ms, 500 ms, and 1000 ms, when compared to ratings made without time constraints. Only participants’ confidence in their own judgements increased as a function of duration. Likewise, again using photographs of faces, Bar et al. [33] reported medium positive correlations between ratings at 39 ms and 1700 ms. The authors indicated that the lower threshold was sufficient for reliable assessments of threat but not intelligence, supporting the theory that rapid first impressions serve as a mean of self-preservation and help determine appropriate approach-avoidance behaviour [1, 33, 38]. The idea being that it should not require much information to decide whether a stranger is friend or foe. Finally, Todorov and colleagues [39] obtained a similar finding, again for faces, showing 33 ms of exposure to be sufficient to distinguish between trustworthy- and untrustworthy-looking stimuli. Whilst correlations with control ratings improved between 33 ms and 100 ms, increased exposure duration did not significantly increase the correlations.\nIn voice research, though there are limited studies that consider the reliability of personality judgements across varying lengths of stimulus types, similar findings have been shown as in face research.”\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Activity 3: Active reading\nWhen you are reading journal articles, make sure to take notes and think of how each article can be used to build your rationale in the introduction. Here is a resource you can use to help structure your notes about the studies you are going to use for your introduction: INTRODUCTION NOTES DOCUMENT"

You may have already completed this as a part of your Data analysis chapter, but if you haven’t please do it now. We ask you to compare two published papers against some of the qualitative report ILOs. You can access the activity HERE\n\n\n8.2.2 Activity 2: Going deeper in your analysis\nOne of the characteristics of a strong analysis section is that the writer demonstrates an ability to go beyond paraphrasing/summarising. This activity is designed to help you understand what might be involved in doing so.\nRead the following two extracts from an Analysis section and discuss these questions:\n\nWhich of the two examples is better? Why?\nWhat have the authors done that makes the analysis better?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract 1 - from a study about the impact of the COVID pandemic\n\n\n\nSarah spoke of using her leisure time to plan and fantasise about her wedding:\n“it’s enough of a fantasy… it’s meant to be stressful, but it’s really just been fun. It’s like such a nice break from this humdrum life we’re living in right now” (Sarah: lines 459-461).\nOrganising a significant life event seems to be viewed as granting Sarah an escape from her current monotony. While she refers to it as a “fantasy”, potentially given uncertainty of the pandemic’s progression, she appears to perceive this as constructive and realistic for her future self. Alternately, Mandy’s leisure activity involved impossible daydreams:\n“I started daydreaming more ridiculous stuff… I know it’s never going to come true ’cause it’s not real, but it still entertains me” (Mandy: lines 443-444)\nWhile Mandy seems to be under no illusion that her daydreams are feasible, daydreaming impossible scenarios appears to provide more of a release than realistic situations that are subject to ever changing government regulations (e.g. travel bans) that may fall through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtract 2 - from a study about social media use during the pandemic\n\n\n\nSome participants said it was difficult to fall asleep at night, including those who knew they should fall asleep but could not (“if I can’t stay up and can’t sleep”- Sarah), or participants subjectively thought that they did not need sleep or did not want to fall asleep (“I am not really able to sleep at night, or like, sleep isn’t really needed.” -Andrew)\nParticipants said that they used social media but that it was only positive at certain points:\nI feel like TikTok was fun in the first lockdown during the summer,’cause of all this summer content I guess, but after that it really went downhill. I don’t know like, OK personally I deleted all my apps about three weeks ago (John)\nJohn tells us here that he deleted all his apps, because they all went ‘downhill’. Tik Tok was helpful during the first lockdown, but not after it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow me the answer\n\n\n\n\n\nExample 1 (COVID):\nThis is the better example, because it goes beyond paraphrasing. The researcher is analysing the quotes and have engaged with the meaning behind the words. Each quote is selected in a way that helps the author build a narrative of what is happening in the data\nExample 2 (sleep): This is the weaker example, because the author just paraphrases what the participants say. This ends up not adding any real value in terms of analysis, because the reader could just read the quote. The narrative needs to analyse the data and show the reader why they interpret something in a particular way."

    "text": "8.3 Evaluation in discussions\nIn this section, we aim to provide some guidance about how to go beyond description in your writing. We will specifically focus on the Discussion section for your RM2 qualitative report here, but you can apply this to other types of writing. In particular, it should be helpful for you as you proceed to your dissertation.\n\n8.3.1 What were your findings?\nIn your discussion section, start off by telling us what you found in your analysis. However, the key thing to think about here, in terms of evaluation, is to relate your findings to the wider research. It will be likely a good idea to consider on a theme by theme basis (if you are doing themes with no sub-themes) or on a subtheme basis (if you have one theme with 2-3 subthemes).\nSome things to consider:\n\nWhat did you find? What was your specific contribution?\nThinking about your findings, what are the similarities and differences from other research findings/theory? Why might this be the case?\nSituate your findings within the broader context - tell the reader about why your findings are important. This can help a reader understand the importance of the results.\nDo your findings challenge existing research? If so, in what way?\nCan you bring in any critical thinking?\n\n\n8.3.1.1 Activity 1\nRead the paragraphs below (from Crompton et al., 2020) and think about what the authors are communicating, with a view to considering the points above.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nHow the authors summarised their results\nThe contribution of the themes to the evidence base\nHow the authors discuss their results in relation to existing research\nHow the authors relate their findings to theory\nHow the authors link the findings to ‘broader issues’\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 1: Crompton et al., 2020\n\n\n\nThis study aimed to examine the experiences of autistic adults spending time with autistic and non-autistic family and friends using a thematic analysis framework. Social relationships are an important, though often complicated, part of autistic people’s lives. Previous research has tended to focus on autistic people’s relationships with (assumed) non-autistic friends and family. Here, we specifically contrasted relationships across and within neurotypes. The analysis revealed three themes: cross-neurotype understanding, minority status and belonging. The themes help us understand why relationships between autistic and non-autistic people might be so challenging, and how relationships between autistic people are different.\nThe results align with previous research on the challenges that autistic people face when interacting with non-autistic others, but highlight that interactions with other autistic people are fundamentally different. All participants reported that spending time with non-autistic family and friends involved specific difficulties, which were not experienced when interacting with other autistic friends and family. This aligns with the double-empathy theory of autism which suggests that autistic and non-autistic people have a mutual difficulty in understanding and empathising with one another due to differences in how each person understands and experiences the world, rather than because of a communicative deficit on the part of the autistic person (Milton, 2012). Neurotypical people have been shown to overestimate how ego-centric their autistic family members are (Heasman & Gillespie, 2018), and overestimate how helpful they are to autistic people (Heasman & Gillespie, 2019). Our findings suggest that this translates into real-world difficulties in interactions with neurotypical friends and family that may affect the mental health, well-being and self-esteem of autistic people.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 What are the implications of the study?\nIn addition to theoretical implications you would discuss in a quantitative study, there is scope to discuss broader implications here. Try not to go too far in these implications (e.g. saying that the NHS/University could make changes to how they run mental health services…this would require a much more extensive body of work).\nSome things to consider:\n\nHow could these findings be applied to real-life situations?\nWhat impact might this have for society in the future (even if with the caveat that it would depend on future research)?\nCan you back up your assertions with reference to the literature? Arguments here are much stronger if you are able to cite papers to support.\n\n\n8.3.2.1 Activity 2\nRead the paragraph below from Robertson et al. (2018) and think about how the authors have communicated the implications of the research.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nWhat the implications of the research are\nHow the authors link the findings to practical suggestions\nHow the authors back up these suggestions to the existing literature base\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 2: Robertson et al., 2018\n\n\n\nThere are a number of potential clinical applications for the findings detailed in this paper. They echo the modifications that are already undertaken for anxiety interventions designed for children and adolescents with ASD (Walters, Loades, & Russell, 2016). For example, it may be important to include support for individuals undertaking an intervention for their anxiety. This has already been identified as helpful in anxiety management interventions for children with ASD (Sofronoff et al., 2005), but the evidence here suggests that this might also be the case for adults. Furthermore, as adults reported feeling that they enjoyed interacting with other autistic people, it would be important to test whether running autism-only groups in terms of anxiety interventions helps outcomes or other aspects related to the feasibility of anxiety management programs (e.g. retention of participants).\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.3 Limitations\nAll research will have limitations - there is never going to be a perfect study. Research is about weighing up the options and choosing the best design for the specific question we want to answer. Remember that qualitative research is not automatically limited because it is not quantitative. Therefore, be very careful not to use criteria we have for quantitative studies (e.g. generalisability, reliability, small sample sizes) and apply them to qualitative studies. Doing so would be similar to critiquing a behavioural study for not asking participants about their experience of interacting with the stimuli ;)\nSome things to consider:\n\nDo you think the quality, source, or types of data (or the analytic process) might have affected the methodological integrity in some way? If so, how?\nRemember to link your limitations to the evidence base. This makes your argument much stronger than if you do not cite to back your points up.\nIf you want to mention generalisability, perhaps consider the concept of transferability instead, which is much more relevant to qualitative.\nTry to aim for depth rather than breadth here - it’s much stronger to have two points addressed comprehensively than have 12 limitations, each covered in a single sentence (you don’t want to make your discussion section a limitations-fest!).\n\n\n8.3.3.1 Activity 3\nRead the paragraph below from Toivo & Scheepers (2019). Although this is not a qualitative paper, the following paragraph exhibits many of the strengths noted above.\nIn particular, identify:\n\nWhat was the limitation observed?\nHow do the authors discuss this limitation, and consider the effect it might have had?\nHow do the authors back up their arguments with evidence from the literature base?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy 3: Toivo et al., 2019\n\n\n\nOne concern might be that we did not explicitly control for L2 proficiency in our sample of bilinguals, which is likely to affect cognitive effort in processing L2. However, all of our bilingual participants (a) self-reported to be highly proficient in English, (b) were Glasgow University students using English as their language of study, and (c) had been living in an English-speaking country for minimum of three months (average: two years and four months) when the study was conducted. Together with the fact that post-trial word recognition rates were well above 90% across participant groups and conditions (Fig 2), we do not believe that variation in L2 proficiency was large enough to have a major impact on our results. That said, we agree that proficiency should ideally be controlled for in future research, e.g. by adding a suitable measure as another person-specific covariate in the analyses. Previous research had identified proficiency as a potential mediating factor of perceived emotionality in the Bilingualism and Emotions Questionnaire [50], and it had also been suggested that bilinguals with close-to-native proficiency in L2 show similar affective processing in L1 and L2 [19].\n\n\n\n\n\n8.3.4 Anything else?\nThe points above are the key components that we would expect to see in a Discussion section, with some guidance on how to go beyond description. However, you might also consider strengths and future research. It’s also good to include a brief conclusion. You won’t have the word count available to go into the same detail as in these papers, so try to use the examples above to really focus on what you can incorporate within your Discussion section to strengthen your evaluative writing."

    "section": "\n9.3 Developing a research question",
    "text": "9.3 Developing a research question\nAs part of writing up your qualitative report, we ask that you develop a research question to help you guide your enquiry. Here is some guidance on how to get started:\n\n9.3.1 Getting started with the data\nFor this report, you are using secondary data. This means that the data have already been collected using specific interview questions - before you start thinking about your research question, make sure to have a look at the interview schedule for your chosen dataset (this document will list the interview questions the researchers asked the participants). This should guide you in what questions you might ask and what kind of question you might be able to answer with the available data. You can also take a look at some of the transcripts to get a better feel for the data.\nLooking at the data before you decide on your RQ might feel a bit strange after RM1, but remember that you are not doing hypothesis-testing with qualitative designs - it is quite normal for a qualitative research question to change during the research process, and this is completely fine as you are not statistically testing for a specific effect.\nBe mindful that you are not making a research question that is actually one of the interview questions - your RQ should be broader than what the specific interview questions are.\nOne of the most common mistakes that students make when framing their research question in RM2 is that it is a little too ‘quant’ in nature. This makes perfect sense, as most of your research methods education so far in the programme has been focused on quant! However, for your qual report, your RQ should be a little different to the RQs you are used to.\nLook at the following examples:\n\nHow does poor sleep impact on wellbeing?\nWhat is the difference in wellbeing between those who belong to university and those who don’t?\n\nBoth questions are a bit too quantitative in nature (i.e. 1 is causal and 2 is about a difference between groups). They would also benefit from thinking about what is being looked at, specifically (e.g. views, opinions, experiences).\nWe’d perhaps rephrase these as follows:\n\nWhat are students’ perceptions of the relationship between sleep and wellbeing?\nWhat are online conversion students’ experiences of belonging to University? How do these experiences relate to perceived wellbeing?\n\nThese questions are now a bit more in line with qualitative and are specific about what they are asking in each (and also what the group of interest is). The second one covers a bit more than the first, which is why it is split into two (a main RQ and a subsidiary one)\n\n9.3.2 Some tips for developing a research question\n\n\nCommunication: Keep your research question simple and specific. If you have a very broad question, it can be helpful to break the question down into smaller sub-questions.\n\nType of question: We want the RQ to tap in to more than ‘descriptive’ experience but also offer scope to explore the ‘how’ and ‘why’ of psychological experience–Is the question asking about experiences, understanding, accounts of practice, or influencing factors?\n\n\nPractical constraints: Can the question realistically be explored using thematic analysis and using secondary data? Try not to cover too much\n\nGuiding: Remember that your RQ guides your enquiry but shouldn’t be restrictive - it’s not the case that you are unable to report themes that don’t directly answer your RQ.\n\nFlexibility: Research questions are more flexible than hypotheses-it is acceptable for the focus of the RQ to be refined during/after data collection.\n\n9.3.3 Formative feedback on your RQ\nIf you would like to receive formative feedback on your RQ, you can submit it on this Padlet by the end of week 5, semester 2. Please note that RQs submitted later than that will not receive feedback.\nIf you would like to discuss your RQ, you can also attend Ashley’s and Wil’s office hours."

    "text": "9.4 Qualitative report guide\n\n9.4.1 Using this report guide\nThis guide is intended to help you in the write up of your qualitative project report. When writing your report, remember to use the other resources available to you:\n\nYour feedback for your RM1 report\nBraun & Clarke (2013) have an excellent chapter on writing up qualitative research\nBraun & Clark (2022) book\nAll the resources available in this book (particularly sections for 4. Data analysis and 7. Academic writing)\nPublished articles which use a Thematic Analysis\nA helpful resource for APA formatting is OWL Purdue\n\nUse the assessment criteria on Moodle as a checklist before you submit the report, to ensure you have addressed all points. If you have questions post on Teams and/or visit our office hours. All the best in writing your report.\n\n9.4.2 General writing style\nYour writing should be clear, concise and easy to follow - remember that academic writing does not need to be complicated to be good. Maintain a neutral, academic tone throughout. Discuss one idea/argument per paragraph.\nYou should format your in-text citations and references in APA 7th style.\nAPA writing style encourages the use of active voice (“I coded the data” rather than “the data were coded”) but if you feel more comfortable writing in passive voice, feel free to do so - just make sure to be consistent throughout and be careful not to make your writing overly complex.\nYou can use first person singular (I) or plural (we) but in the reflexivity section make sure to write in first person singular, as this is your reflection of your own positionality to the RQ and the data, and it’s often very personal.\n\n9.4.3 Report sections\nYou should include all the sections listed here:\n\nTitle\nAbstract\nIntroduction\nMethod\nAnalysis\nDiscussion\nReferences\n\n\n9.4.3.1 Title\nThe title should reflect the research question(s) and define your sample (e.g., UG students experience of…). Be specific should include:\n\nWho\nWhat\nHow\n\nExamples:\n\nA Thematic Analysis (how) of the panic attack experiences (what) of primary aged children in inner city Schools in the UK (who)\n\nBarriers and enablers to modifying sleep behaviour (what) in adolescents and young adults (who): A qualitative investigation (how)\n\n\n9.4.3.2 Abstract (suggested word count: 100-150 words)\nIn an academic journal, the function of an abstract is to allow the reader to decide whether or not to read the full article. Aim to summarise all sections of the report in 150 words, including; 1) area of research 2) aim of the study 3) brief methodology, 4) approach to analysis , 5) main findings, and 6) main ‘take-away’/ headline findings and implications. Outline your main themes as findings instead of statistics - as would be typical in a quantitative report. Keep in mind that you are summarising your research for a non-expert and you want to “entice” them to read more.\n\n9.4.3.3 Introduction (suggested word count 750-850 words)\nThe aim of the introduction is to provide the reader with the necessary background to interpret your rationale for further research - this is true whether you are using qualitative or quantitative led enquiry. You are expected to provide a detailed, critical literature review of relevant, published research (quantitative and/or qualitative) for this topic/area. Identify the key issues and debates, and use these to develop an argument for your study. As with any introduction to an APA research report, you should develop the introduction using the’ funnel approach’. You start with a broad overview of the topic and get more and more specific, until you arrive at the rationale for ‘your’ research and of course the research question(s).\nRemember you have a limited number of words to say all of this, so your literature review should focus on relevant and recent articles in the area that have influenced your choice of research question. Do try to locate the most recent examples of qualitative research in this well defined topic area - take the reader to the last example of relevant research and say how you plan to ‘build’ on this research - helping to create a great rationale! Remember to reference all sources of information in the text (for example, government reports, websites, media reports).\nA resource for helping you to develop evaluation in your introductions can be found HERE\n\n\n\n\nBroad-to-narrow structure of an introduction\n\n\n\nYou should end with a statement of what the aim of your study was, and the research question.\nNext, remember to outline any limitations of previous studies - critique (however, make sure the limitations you discuss are actually something your study can address - otherwise your rationale will not be very strong)! Instead of just describing previous studies, try to evaluate them. What do the findings mean? Are there any contrasting findings? If so, why? This should lead clearly to a justification of your own study; how will your study address these issues? This should not be done independently of your literature review. When you are outlining the research and theory you should be developing a clear rationale for your research question.\nFinally, explain your study and clearly outline your research question/s.\nIn sum:\n\nReview and evaluate previous theories and research relevant to the topic.\nProvide a clear justification and explanation of your study, linked to your research questions\nThe main and subsidiary research questions have been outlined clearly and offer good alignment with qualitative methods (in this case a thematic approach).\n\nRemember that the point of this section is exactly the same as a quantitative report: you are demonstrating what work has been done in the past, to build up an argument as to why the current study has been conducted.\n\n9.4.3.4 Method (suggested word count 350-450 words)\nThe aim of the method section is to clearly report how your study was conducted – the reader should be able to re-run your research from the details provided. In this case, contextualise the original study your secondary data are from, report details of the original data collection, explain your process of refining and selecting the data used for your project, and describe the qualitative analysis you used. True ‘replication’ is difficult due to central role of researcher in influencing some aspects of the research such as analysis. This is not an experiment.\nFollow these subheadings for your method section for this report:\nSecondary data\nIn this section you should describe the original study and give the reader context about their data collection. Understanding the specific context of each study is a key element of qualitative research, which is why it is really important for you to explain that in order for your secondary analysis to be reported openly.\nWhat was the original study about? Who conducted it? Where are the data available? You should cite your chosen dataset in APA style (do not provide a link in text) - each dataset has this information on the UK data service page under the Citation and copyright section. How many interviews did they conduct, what was the methodology they used for the interviews (you should find this information on the UK Data Service page for your chosen data set)? Who were their participants? What were the participants asked about?\nIf you have demographic information about the participants on the UK Data Service Website, you may wish to include this, but don’t worry if your chosen dataset doesn’t provide this - we don’t expect you to report any information that was not available to you.\nData selection\nIn this section you should describe your procedure for choosing your final data set. How many interviews did you choose? How did you choose the specific ones you decided to use for your analysis?\nEthics\nThe information you are able to provide in this section will depend on the information made available within the dataset. Some things you might want to comment on include: anonymisation procedures (e.g. has information been replaced or redacted), rapport building, information/consent/debrief, consent as a process. You will only be able to include information that has been made available in the dataset, so do not worry if you do not know a lot of detail.\nReflexivity\nIn qualitative research it is important to acknowledge the role of the researcher in interpretation of the data (Elliot & Fischer & Rennie, 1999). This is where you question your own motives and attitudes in doing this project. Obviously we told you that you had to do it. But what assumptions did you hold prior to beginning the research? Had you considered issues around the topic previously? Did they match what the interviews say? Or did you disagree with them? Did this affect which interviews you chose to include in your analysis? And if so, how did this impact on your analysis? Because different people would interpret the data differently, it is useful for you to expose your own attitudes at this point so that others can see how you have impacted on the analysis. See Braun & Clarke (2013, pp36-37, 303-304) and activities around reflexivity. Reflexive analysis should be concise for this project, perhaps around 3-4 sentences.\nData Analysis\nIn this section, report the following:\n\nDetails on the analysis you are using\nBriefly outline the your theoretical approach (look back at the second part of the lecture in Semester 1 Week 8 for help with this if needed)\nOutline the different stages of the analysis. Qualitative analysis is accused of being fluffy/opaque sometimes. BE SPECIFIC about the stages of analysis. It’s good practice at this stage to refer directly to a methodologists guidelines (e.g. Smith IPA, B and C for TA etc). Literally outline it as STAGE1: STAGE 2: etc. For the project, 2-3 sentences outlining the stages (please note, this is in total, NOT per stage!) is sufficient. A high quality account of the approach to analysis should offer transparency - try to ‘open up the box’ to be clear about what goes on between noting codes and arriving at themes. Remember that the researcher observes themes in the data - they do not emerge\n\n\n9.4.3.5 Analysis (suggested word count: 750-900 words)\nYour analysis section is the part of the project where you show the evidence you have collected. It is similar therefore to a Results Section in a quantitative report. It is useful to use sub-headings here. Each sub-heading will state the name of each theme/sub-theme. You may wish to number these sub-headings.\nThe aim is to make your analysis as transparent as possible, so that anyone can see how you have arrived at your interpretations from your transcript. Quotes and the narrative you develop in this section should be supported using sections taken from the transcript. Start by giving an overview of the main themes in a paragraph (NO QUOTES AT THIS TIME), then present your first themes, inserting supporting quotes at appropriate points.\nLonger quotes should be indented to the centre, separated from the main text by a line before and after,and should include name or number of the participant. Shorter quotes can be embedded in the text (see example below). Guidelines for presenting quotes from participants in APA format can be found HERE.\nPLEASE NOTE: most qualitative analyses require you to provide some analytical commentary after each quote. This addresses the assessment criteria about themes being evidenced by quotes AND described and interpreted within a narrative. See the Semester 2 Week 6 materials on developing a narrative and the Braun & Clarke (2013) text (chapter 11) for examples for analytical commentary.\nSee an example of how to format quotes in APA style HERE\nDue to the word limit we recommend that you:\n\nChoose a maximum of 2 themes to include in the Analysis Section. You may have found more in the analyses, but the scope and word limit of the project allows you to develop a narrative and evidence for 2 main themes with no subthemes. One alternative would be to report one theme with 2-3 subthemes. You may identify more themes than this, which is fine, but please stick to the guidelines here.\nIntroduce and explain each theme briefly using sub headings\nInclude 3-5 quotes support each theme (include the Pseudonym/participant number)\nIf you want to use a quote that is too long – or includes unnecessary detail – you can remove part of the text and replace it with ellipses. However, remember that you should NEVER alter any of the words/phrasing used, even if you think you know what the participant was going to say. This would be the same (and as unacceptable) as editing numbers in a quantitative analysis!\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat to aim for and avoid in the analysis\n\n\n\nPlease note that, although it says page and line number in the above table, we realise you might not have this information. It is therefore fine just to present the name of the participant for each quote, and you do not need to include page/line numbers too\n\n9.4.3.6 Discussion (suggested word count: 750-850 words)\nSome activities to support you with developing evaluation in your Discussion section can be found HERE.\nThe aim of the discussion is to summarise and explain your overall findings and consider how they help inform the research questions. It will be necessary to consider the findings in relation to previous research and theories (that are referenced in the Introduction). You should also discuss any practical implications of your findings, methodological limitations, and suggestions for further research.\nStart by briefly summarising your RQs and the themes that you have observed. How do your findings add to, or fit with previous research? You can either take each main theme as a big discussion or break it down to sub-theme theme level. Be critical. Bring in the literature you discussed in the introduction, and new literature if need be. Do your findings agree/disagree with previous studies? Do your findings challenge existing research in any way? Did your methodology uncover something that the other studies couldn’t get at? - basically… what is your contribution?\nImplications: In addition to theoretical implications you would normally discuss in a quantitative report in psychology, there is also scope for discussion of the implications. Remember to only discuss implications that you can realistically relate to your own findings, and to support your arguments with evidence. Try to over some specifics and not vague/general implications.\nLimitations: You only used a maximum of three interviews (as we did not want to overload you). However, avoid evaluating your study purely on quantitative standards such as validity and reliability and sample size. We strongly suggest that you do not use lack of generalisation as a limitation. This can be contradictory to the philosophy of the method of analysis. Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses on qualitative grounds, e.g., were interviews the best way of eliciting the information for this particular topic? For guidance on evaluating qualitative research against a set of guidelines see Yardley (2000) & Braun & Clarke (2013, Ch 12).\nSuggestions for future research How would you improve on your study? If you had the chance what kind of research questions would you like to ask? Make sure these are also evidence-based and make sense following from your study. Limitations and future directions don’t necessarily need to be separate sections; often, a future suggestion flows logically from a limitation.\nThink of your research project as an apprenticeship. We are not looking for you to do the perfect research project at your first attempt so don’t be shy about pointing out the things you could have done better. But be constructive. It’s not so much about telling us what you did wrong, as telling us what you have learned and how you would improve this study if you got another chance.\nConclusion: End your report with a brief paragraph summarising your key conclusions from the study.\n\n\n\n\nNarrow-to-broad structure of a discussion\n\n\n\n\n9.4.3.7 Recap of word count for each section of the report\n\nABSTRACT: 100-150 words\nINTRODUCTION: 700-800 words\nMETHOD: 350-450 words\nANALYSIS: 750-900 words\nDISCUSSION: 750-850 words\n\n9.4.3.8 References\nReferences both in the main body of text and in the reference list are structured in exactly the same way as in a quantitative report using APA 7th style.\n\n9.4.3.9 Appendices\nAn appendix (plural: appendices) is a supplementary document which forms part of a main document but is not essential for its completeness, containing supporting information, and usually appearing at the end.\nThe appendix can often hold a lot of information. In the qualitative report we ask you to include the following in the appendices of the report:\n\nA list of the interviews you have chosen and a link to the original dataset (you should not include the transcripts themselves)\nA sample of initial coding of the transcript\nYou might also have a list of the interview questions (if easily obtained from your transcripts or study documentation on UK data service)\n\n9.4.3.10 Further reading\nThe RM2 reading list has examples of how qualitative research is presented and written up. The APA Reporting Standards for Qualitative Research provide comprehensive guidance on how to write up a qualitative article. These guidelines are very detailed and go beyond the scope of what you need to report in the qualitative report, but do provide insight into how to report methods and analysis (in particular) in a transparent way. If in doubt consult the guidance on this book chapter, the assessment information sheet for the course and ask on the Teams channel."

    "section": "10.1 General Project questions",
    "text": "10.1 General Project questions\nHow do the portfolio and qualitative report work together - should we focus on one before looking at the other? The qualitative portfolio is designed to support you in developing skills that would be important for actually running qualitative studies (e.g. reflexivity, developing questions, awareness of ethics, awareness of good/bad practice for data collection). The report is designed to support you in developing your data analysis skills and then writing up this information into a report.\nRe. the timescales - we would advise that you start working (or at least thinking about) the qualitative report before your qualitative portfolio is handed in. However, we realise everyone is different and prefer to work in different ways. We have developed a timeline for the summative assessment with suggested milestones, although you should revise these deadlines to find something that works for you."

    "title": "10  Frequently Asked Questions",
    "section": "10.2 Qualitative portfolio questions",
    "text": "10.2 Qualitative portfolio questions\n\n10.2.1 General portfolio questions\nWhere can I find information about the qualitative portfolio? You can find information about the portfolio in the template, the guidelines, the AIS and the video Wil recorded. You can access the materials in chapter 6 of this book.\nWhat is the word count for each section? This is in the template, but it can be broken down as follows: Activity 1a (no word limit for the six questions), Activity 1b (250 words), Activity 2 (250 words), Activity 3 (500 words).\nIn the answers, should we use or avoid acronyms such as BPS and GDPR? Usually in your writing you should avoid unnecessary abbreviations unless they are really commonly used, as this makes it harder for the reader to follow your writing. A good general rule of thumb is not to come up with any abbreviations yourself. These two are very common for the context of your assignment so you can use them (this will also help with the word count which is very limited here).\nDo we need to set out an introduction and concluding summary in our responses to each of the sections? You don’t need this - you can dive straight in :)\nIs it okay for us to take what a study says at face value (i.e. the study says x, which backs up the point)? Or do we have to be critical about the study? Yes, this is fine - we expect you to use the studies to support the points you are making, rather than critically interrogating how well the study supports the claim. It would not really be possible to do the latter within the word count. This assessment is a bit different to when you are writing a report, for example, where you’d want to show how you are building on the existing literature (to help support your rationale)\nI can’t figure out how to cite the BPS code; examples online are both “BPS,2021” and “Oates et al., 2021” Cite it as BPS.\nIs it okay to answer the questions or do we have to make a unique contribution (as you do in an essay or a report)? Just doing what you are asked is fine. This is not the same type of assessment as a report or essay as it is focusing on skills needed to run a project, so it will be assessing different things.\nShould I delete the included instructions from the template document so it’s just the headings for each section? Either keeping them or deleting them is fine - whichever you prefer.\nCan I use guidelines and and strategies for qualitative research from fields other than psychology? Yes, perfectly fine to use these guidelines - you don’t have to stick to Psychology. Just make sure that the guidelines apply to the type of research methodology/RQ you are discussing.\nIs slight variability in word count between the sections allowed as long as the final product is less than 1000? Yes, there is slight variability allowed - it is overall 1000 but you can change the distribution that is suggested slightly (however, try not to change by more than 30-40 words so you provide the right amount of detail for each section).\n\n\n10.2.2 Task 1: Qualitative questions & reflection\nTo what extent can we refine the sample? The RQ refers to ‘students’, but could we specify that further by limiting it to only students who have / not sought out mental health support? Yes, if you want to limit it further, this is fine - we kept it somewhat flexible on purpose so you have a bit of freedom with this.\nWhat sort of evidence is relevant in a reflection? Is it related to the topic (i.e. of mental health) or is it more about the anticipated problems / other researchers protocol in similar research? Or a bit of both? Should we avoid trying to justify our choices in the reflection, or is that a good thing to do? I think it would make sense if it’s more related to methods rather than the topic choice - would be quite good to justify your choices in the reflection.\nWould it be a good idea to include a warm up question/ice breaker and a closing question in our six questions? For the purposes of this assessment, we would suggest just sticking to the six main questions (i.e. not using up two of these for a warm up/exit question). This is because we ask for a limited number, and that way we can keep things consistent across the whole class. One thing you might want to consider is your placement of questions (i.e. the order in which you would ask them).\nWhat is the difference between an interview and a qualitative survey? Interview is where the researcher is one-to-one with a participant and asks them questions. Qualitative survey is a qualitative questionnaire that is often sent to participants online and they fill it out in writing.\nHow does (evidence based) reflection differ (if at all) from (evidence based) writing that we have been doing so far for our assignments? It doesn’t really - we want you to look at the evidence and back up your ideas with relevant sources. The portfolio materials have some probes for your reflection. In the ethics task you should also use the BPS code of ethics and refer to that as well.\nFor activity 1, do we would need to pick a specific topic area (from the evidence base) to explore in more depth in order to frame our questions? The overall topic and research question is given to you in the materials, and then you need to come up with focus group/interview/qualitative survey questions that you would ask the participants to investigate the research question\nShould we mark some of the questions as priority with a star, to note the ones that we would ask first if time was running short in the focus group? You can asterisk the ones you deem most important if you want to, but there is no requirement to do so either (so basically, whichever you prefer)\nCan we include prompts underneath some of the questions? You can if you want, but we ask you to stick to a maximum of one prompt per question if you do this (and that it’s really clear for the reader what the main question is and what the prompt is)\nIs there scope to include visual prompts in our questions? Theoretically yes, although we’ve never seen this asked before so wouldn’t know what a visual prompt would look like. If you want to include this, it might be worth contacting Ashley / Wil to show them an example.\nWhat should we focus our reflection on? About half of the word count in our reflection is currently taken up by an evidence-based discussion of why we opted for the FG format over the interview as this really guided how we constructed the questions thereafter. I just want to know if such a focus is correct or if you’re looking for discussion to centre more around a specific question or two that we chose?\nThere is no one correct way to structure the reflection. We are interested in how you found the experience and why you made the decisions that you did in constructing your list of questions. We often see reflections on why people chose a particular approach for their questions too (e.g. focus group over interview/survey).\nYou have advised that we choose 1 or 2 issues and go into their depth when answering the questions on ethics and the terrible FG. What do you recommend we do for the reflections on the questions in task 1? Do we for instance speak about why we chose a specific approach over the other? Why we chose these specific questions? Challenges we faced etc. Or do we combine everything? Now, we have 250 words of a general reflection on FGs, guideline designing on the topic under discussion, challenges we faced, and what we couldn’t get with citations of course. I’m wondering if we should be more focused and try to answer only 1 point? Basically, we don’t specify what you can and can’t reflect on, so as long as it’s relevant (which this is), then you have some flexibility :) It is a very open question and we are anticipating lots of different ways of answering this one in particular. The main thing is to follow the guidelines that have been given and to look at the ILOs, to see how well you think your response is meeting them\nIs it appropriate to briefly describe our own expertise and experiences, and how they’ve informed our decisions? Would this count as reflexivity and would you like to see evidence of reflexivity? Or would you rather we didn’t talk about ourselves directly? Yes, this would be completely appropriate to discuss as part of reflexivity. It’s fine to discuss yourselves directly (but it is not the only way to do this task). You would be reflecting on why you made the choices you did and would be demonstrating what experiences you have that went into those. Be mindful to make this evidence-based too!\nWe have included a short rationale on why we chose a focus group which is placed before the six questions. Will this short paragraph be included within the word count for the whole portfolio or will it not count as part of the 1000 words? A rationale (if you choose to include it) should be in 1b. The only thing not included in the word count within the activities themselves is the actual questions of Activity 1a\nDo prompts/probes have to be phrased as a question or can they be more of a statement? They will usually be framed as a question but it is fine to write them as a statement for this assignment if you prefer.\nDo we need to define terms such as open-ended questions? No, there isn’t space for this within the word count for this particular assignment\nIf we’re including our group member’s experiences for reflexivity, should we name them, or just refer to them as ‘group member’? You can either use initials or “group member”, either one would be fine\nWithin the questions we are setting for our group project - would it be appropriate to name “University of Glasgow” for instance or would it be best to keep to just “University” in general? We would suggest just sticking to University, rather than specifying the University of Glasgow in particular.\nis it OK to assume that the participants work in the same university as its important for a point we’ve made in the moderating? Yes, this is fine :)\n\n\n10.2.3 Task 2: Ethics\nShould we connect our answer to Question 2 to what we did for Q1? No, there is no expectation that Activity 2 is linked to Activity 1 (although Activites 1a and 1b need to be linked to each other).\nCan you tell us where people tend to go most wrong in this particular question? Sometimes, groups will focus more on ethical issues that are relevant for quantitative research, or research in general, rather than specifically thinking about qualitative research. This is something that is best avoided as it doesn’t answer the question that is set.\n\n\n10.2.4 Task 3: Focus group gone wrong\nFor focus group, do we have to back the issue with specific observations from the video? E.g @ 4.05min X did what, which is an issue because… No, this would likely take up too many words.\nIs there a preference for either moderator or facilitator? No, these are interchangeable and either is fine\nAre we to only quote peer reviewed literature in support of our argument, or can we quote for example from the Braun and Clarke book? No, it’s fine to cite Braun & Clarke and there might also be guides/opinion pieces etc. - these would also be fine to use in support. Also, it’s fine to use older evidence too - we do realise there’s unlikely to be lots of 2022/2023 papers out there on how to do a focus group! We have also included some additional papers on the reading list (under Thinking about the focus group) to give a bit of a start (although please note we haven’t had time to read these…we’ve skimmed through)\nWe have identified the point we want to talk about. For example, it is about the moderator’s part. Should we focus on the moderator’s issue in general or pick a couple of specific examples of bad moderating and write about them in depth? Because the word count is limited, it isn’t apparent what strategy to pursue. Either is fine to be honest. You could pick moderating as one issue and then another one. Or you could focus on two separate parts of moderation. My main suggestion would be to pick an approach that allows you to go into depth on the issue, explaining why it is a problem, what could be improved etc.\nI’m struggling with how to approach the focus group task- do you have any examples excellent or ‘A’ standard work? We don’t provide exemplars, because this assessment is specific so it would be really hard to do that without giving out the answers. In terms of what the focus group task is asking, please make sure you read the ILOs for this assessment that can be found on the AIS document. The only ILO specific for the FG task is:\nCorrectly identify TWO or THREE issues present in the focus group, explain why they are problematic, and discuss possible improvements (#3: Focus group), which means that you should identify what is wrong in how the focus group is conducted (this is mostly based on what the moderator is/isn’t doing), explain why these things are not good when you are conducting a FG, and explain how they could approach this instead.\nTo meet the other ILOs for this task, you should make sure you write clearly and concisely and demonstrate evaluation in your answer (this is an ILO for all your assessments you have done to date and means that you need to use evidence to build your arguments and go beyond description). For this task evaluation should include you explaining why your chosen issues are bad practice when conducting a focus group, and citing some evidence (this will mostly be methodological in nature) to back up your answer.\nFor the focus group task, do we need to include quotes from the transcript when referring to the issues? No, we would advise that you don’t do this, as it will take up a lot of the (very limited!) word count. Instead of quoting, just say what the participant/facilitator did that you think explains the issue you have identified.\nWhen I’m evaluating a study, do you want me to criticise it? Do you want me to talk about the methodology? For this assessment, we aren’t really looking for you to criticise the studies that you are using - for example, for the focus group task, it’s more about explaining why it’s a bad thing that the moderator is doing and then using some evidence to back that up (e.g. some guidance for how to run a focus group or if there’s a paper saying what you might want to do to make your participants feel more comfortable). Here, it’s not about saying ‘here’s this study, it had x participants’ - that is more for the report, where you are building a rationale.\nWould a good structure be: x happened, x is bad for y reason, z should be done instead (with studies to back up)? There are different ways that you can structure it but the above example would be fine. The main thing is that you are covering what we ask of you in the guidance and the ILOs.\nShould we include timestamps of when something happened in the video? No, this is not necessary to include - just telling us what you’ve identified will be fine\nA lot of the literature is pretty old. What should I do? We are aware that some of the literature is older, and it’s completely fine to use this. It’s not the same type of assessment as essays/reports etc., and lot of the guidance is from the 90s or so.\nDo we refer to the participants in the terrible video by their names eg: Ashley, Gaby? Or we call them participant 1, 2, 3, or the moderator (or Wilhelmina) did this with a participant, and that with another participant? I think generally I would say ‘a participant’ etc. as it depersonalises it. However, you do have the names there as they were on the video and - as we haven’t given any guidance specifically on this - it won’t affect the marking in any way if you use our names."

    "text": "10.3 Qualitative report questions\n\n10.3.1 General report questions\nWill there be detailed guidance about each section of the qual report? Yes, we have a guidance in this book in the qualitative report section in chapter 8, which will cover the key points to cover in the report.\nIs our report written in a specific style, e.g. IPA, thematic analysis etc? You will use thematic analysis to analyse your data. We covered this in detail in the lectures in semester 1, and we will also have activities to support this in semester 2.\nHow many interviews should we select for our report? We ask that you choose a maximum of three interviews to analyse (less than this is fine if you have enough data within your chosen interviews)\nI’m not sure what all the different tasks are for the report - where can we find this information? We haven’t shared an explicit task list for the report and one reason for that is because RM2 is purposefully designed to get you to work a bit more independently in preparation for the dissertation.\nKey stages are as follows:\n\nFamiliarise yourself with what is expected for the report assignment have a look at the data and decide which dataset you want to work with\nLook at the data in more detail - which interviews will you select?\nLook at relevant literature and start to think about your RQ think about the rationale for the study\nConduct your Thematic Analysis\nWrite up the study as a full research report (which will be similar to your RM1 report).\n\nFor the report, I am unclear on the criteria for choosing transcripts. I have an approximate idea of a RQ and looking at the transcripts they could be broadly grouped into 2 sets relating to how the participant responds to the questions. Is the intention to choose transcripts that have a consistent thread or that cover a diverse range of views? With only 3 transcripts I’m not sure if it should be based on commonalities or if this is kind of cherry picking? I would say it’s about choosing transcripts that you will be able to analyse and are relevant to the specific research question that you have. So, it would make sense to pick transcripts that are relevant (i.e. they cover the issue you are interested in). They may or may not have the same perspective - I think either would be okay to be honest. Sometimes, it can be useful to have different views as you can then think about why (which can be interesting in terms of evaluation of your themes) and it’s also fine to have more consistent views too.\nCan I do a different analysis and not TA? For the RM2 project we unfortunately only have assessment guidance and support for doing a thematic analysis (Braun &Clarke’s version) and we currently are unable to expand that to different type of analyses - this is because it’s an introductory qualitative course so the same way as in RM1 you were asked to do a specific analysis on the data, we would like you to stick with TA for the individual report.\nWhat voice should I write in? Should my reflexivity be written in first person? APA style encourages the use of active voice instead of passive voice (“I did” instead of “it was done”). You can use either but make sure to be consistent and don’t make your sentences overly complicated. For reflexivity, you should definitely use “I”, because it is about your own reflection in regards to the RQ and the data\nShould I be writing my report as though I designed and conducted the interviews etc myself? You should not write it as if you collected the data - you should write it as a secondary data analysis.\nI’ve found published papers that are using the same dataset and I’m worried that my research is the exact same/doesn’t add anything new? I feel that I should mention these original reports when I’m setting my study in the wider literature, but I’m not sure how then to argue that my study is adding anything new if I acknowledge these reports - what should I do? The chances of your RQ and all other parameters of the study being identical are not very high; if your RQ is worded exactly the same as a published paper, you may wish to tweak it a little bit to focus on a more specific aspect of the data, so you can explain in the introduction how it adds to existing literature. Also look out for what kind of analysis they did - then you can discuss why TA might be better suited for your RQ/the type of data you have. What subsample of interviews did they use and is yours different? If so, why? It doesn’t need to be an entirely different thing to what is already published; good science is built in incremental steps, so think about what are the things that are different in your study to the published papers, and how that adds to what we already know\n\n\n10.3.2 Research questions\nDo you have any tips for how to arrive at your research question for the qualitative report? This book has a section on developing RQs - work through those activities first. I would probably have a look over some of the datasets and decide what you’d like to focus on in terms of topic. Then I’d think about what kind of information you get from them (e.g. is it people’s opinions/experiences/beliefs etc.) and what you’d be interested in looking at specifically.\nShould our questions be broad enough so we can use the whole transcripts or should we narrow them to focus on specfic areas? I think an obvious example to illustrate what I mean would be on the Life limiting transcripts and then having a question of something like “experiences of animals on wellbeing etc” but that would then heavily focus the content of the analysis on one of the sub areas of the transcript and a lot (but not all) might be irrelevant? Perfectly fine to narrow them to focus on specific areas, but with this I would say make sure that you have enough data about your specific RQ to be able to analyse it. You don’t have to use the whole transcript by any means - completely fine to use subsections. It’s possible to revise your RQ in thematic analysis, so - if you were unsure - you could start off broader and then could make it a bit more specific down the line. There is the caveat that this would affect your intro, as you build towards why you’ve chosen this research question in your rationale.\nCan we post more than one RQ on the padlet if we’re not sure what route to go down? Yes, this is fine - you can post a few and we can give feedback on these (let us know if you have a favourite though)\nDoes the research question have to be tailored towards one of the questions asked in the interview or can it be broader? It’s probably better to be broader - generally, themes will tend to be broader than a single question that is asked and it might be a little on the specific side\n\n\n10.3.3 Introduction & Discussion\nShould we include a mini paragraph at the start of the introduction summarising the research question at the end? We would recommend to avoid it for this specific assignment, as this might make it difficult for you to have a broad-to-narrow structure and could cause unnecessary repetition.\nIn the discussion section, can we refer to the data (e.g. the participants) or if that is too detailed for this section?\nTwo of the interviewees I have picked agree on something whilst the other disagrees so was going to specifically refer to this. Or should I be picking up the broader theme that came out in the discussion section and don’t need to reference the specific point I am referring to? In the discussion you should focus on the themes and discuss them in relation to existing literature/future literature instead of focusing on individual comments from your participants (these you should analyse in the analysis section). If you think back to quant, you are not talking about the specific numbers in the discussion but instead focus on what the findings mean and how they build on existing literature. Sometimes in quali literature you see papers that have a sort of combined analysis and discussion section, in which case they might combine individual quotes and existing literature, but for this assignment we are asking you to separate them to two different sections for clarity and to make it a bit simpler for you to structure.\nDo limitations/future directions need to be separate sections? They don’t need to be two separate paragraphs - often what is a limitation to a study can logically be addressed in the next study.\n\n\n10.3.4 Method\nHow to choose my theoretical framework and where does it go?\nI take it that we are meant to indicate if we are using a constructionist or realist/experientialist framework for the analysis. Are we free to choose this or are there any recommendations? I would assume that focusing on semantic themes is more doable given the limited word count? Also, where would we state this? In the methods section or at the start of the analysis? It would be good to explain which theoretical perspective you are coming from, yes. It’s important to take the word limit into account, so it could well be the case that focusing at a semantic level will be more doable - the key thing in your analysis is that you try to go beyond description, and develop a narrative. If you include details about the framework, this should be done in the Methods section, rather than at the start of the analysis.\nIs there an easy guide to working out what theoretical approach you are using? I understand the difference between realism, social constructionism etc in theory but I can’t work out how to apply it to my work. I kind of think it could be any of them so I think I’m missing something! It’s more about thinking about your own perspective (rather than the dataset), as you are correct - any of the different approaches could be applied to the dataset. You could focus on what type of knowledge you are looking for, or instead, think about epistemology/ontology (or both!). It’s sometimes easier to think about the type of knowledge you want to obtain - if it is knowing more about people’s experiences, and how they describe their world, then that would be about seeking out phenomenological knowledge. If it is more in terms of uncovering something concrete that happens in the world (i.e. a truth) then it would be more realist that you are looking for. If you have questions about the theoretical approach specifically, feel free to pop into any of Ashley’s office hours for a chat\nAlso can we draw upon our personal experiences in the report?\nI’m looking at the LGBT+ dataset and also work in an NHS trust; I’ve seen some transphobic actions happen at work and was wondering if this is appropriate to talk about in the report if appropriate for the RQ Yes, there is a section for reflexivity in the methods section, where you should reflect on your experiences and how you felt about the topic/your experiences. You can also expand on it a bit in the discussion if you want.\nAre there good examples we can have a look at for reference in terms of reflexivity?\nI’m looking through the list of examples studies you have included using thematic analysis, and I don’t think they include any form of reflexivity at least not in the method section, or am I missing something? Or would this be done during analysis? Here are some resources to help, but they are not so much examples of reflexivity sections within papers and - instead - are more about giving guidance. Here are some links to start you off:\n\nBarrett et al (2020): How to…be reflexive when conducting qualitative research\nMcLaughlan et al (2012): Phenomenological analysis of patient experiences of medical student teaching encounters (they embedded reflexivity within the ‘Analysis’ section of the methods\nBlog by Jacqui Burne: https://nzareblog.wordpress.com/2017/11/28/self-reflexivity/\nByrne (2022) A worked example of Braun and Clarke’s approach to reflexive thematic analysis\nExamples of reflective commentary from online resources from ’Reflexive Thematic\nAnalysis’ (2022) by Braun & Clarke: https://study.sagepub.com/thematicanalysis/ student-resources/chapter-3/understanding-the-process (this website has a lot of really useful resources - the book is available through the library)\n\nAre we meant to be using literature to support our reflexivity like we did for the group project reflection? You don’t need to do this - reflexivity for a specific research project is more about thinking about your own positionality and how that might have affected the way you approached your data so it doesn’t need to be supported with evidence.\nDo we need to report the specific questions that we used to extract our results? I mean of course I read the full 3 interviews, however my topic was very specific and it was located in two specific questions in the interviews. Do I need to report that? Furthermore do I need to report all the questions of the interview anyways? I see all the qualitative studies report the full set of the questions. You can add them as an appendix but you don’t need to list them all in the methods section; there you can just describe generally what kind of questions they were asked.\n\n\n10.3.5 Analysis\nDo I need to cite literature in my analysis section?\nAccording to Braun and Clarke (2013) a good analysis section will link back to relevant research previously done on the topic (i.e citations to link it to the wider literature) however, I would presume that this will be better suited to the discussion section of our project given the word count? Or should we cite previous research to link our themes within the analysis section? Qual reports are written in one of two ways: 1) where the analysis and discussion are in separate sections - in the analysis, you report your findings, in the discussion, you link your findings to the literature, identify limitations etc. 2) you have a joint analysis and discussion section, where you both present your results and link them to the research. Braun & Clarke are talking about the second, whereas we’re doing the first option. So, no, just focus on presenting your themes in the analysis section - like with the quant report, you will then have a separate Discussion section where you link to the literature\nIn the thematic analysis, what should we do if two participants give opposite answers for the same questions. How do we deal with that conflicts? This can make for a really interesting analysis and discussion section! You should explain the theme for the reader, and provide context for the different views presented by the participants. You can find more information in the Braun & Clarke (2013) book\nIn the interview transcripts came across a nice statement I would like to quote, however the statement was made by the interviewer not the participant. The participant agreed with the interviewers statement. Would it be appropriate to quote the interviewer in this instance? It might depend on what the statement is and the context. So, for example, is it a) the researcher summarising what the participant said and then the participant agreeing or b) the researcher giving their own opinion about it and the participant agreeing? I’d be more likely to say this is okay to include if it was the first than the second, I think. If you were to include it, it would probably be best to a) make sure that there’s enough context surrounding this (i.e. what was there in the lead up to it and also afterwards?), and b) only do this sparingly.\nCan one of my themes be my RQ or an interview question? No, you should try to go a bit deeper in finding meanings in the data in your analysis. If you end up with a theme that is actually your RQ or one of the interview questions, you have summarised the data rather than analysing it. This is surprisingly easy to do by accident so don’t feel bad if this has happened to you - just go back to the data and look a bit further. What aspects of the RQ does the theme capture? What specifically do the participants say about it?\nCan we use a mixture of inductive and deductive approach?\nActually I started exploring the data without any previous thoughts (inductive) and later I started reading the literature for this topic and unintentionally I started observing some of the same conclusions in my data (deductive). Is this a formal way of analysing the data? Can I report a mixture of approaches? It is possible to do this - here is an example of a paper that used a combination of inductive and deductive coding for TA. This would not be the only way to do it, but is an overview of one possible way in which coding and developing themes could utilise both. My main suggestion would be to be clear with the reader in your methods about the thinking behind your approach.\nWhat if in our analysis we end up developing different themes the three interviews? Do we have to report only the common themes or is it ok if we also analyse themes that are evident only in one or two interviews? Ideally at the themes stage you should consider the dataset as a whole so most of your themes should come from more than one interview Try to find quotes which illustrate the theme not just from one participant. Sometimes themes may be more strongly present in parts of the data and that’s ok but try to avoid having one theme that’s from one participant only and another one that’s from another participant - the themes should represent the data a bit more holistically\nWhat if I develop more than two themes - can I mention the other themes in my analysis section? You can briefly say that you developed more themes but don’t waste your word count on explaining them in more detail or talking about the codes related to them. In terms of the discussion, you should focus on the two themes you have chosen and developed a full narrative for (the same way in quant you would not discuss an analysis you did not actually finish) and connect those to existing literature. You can talk about the other stuff as future directions if you would like\nShould the themes be presented in a hierarchical way related with each other? \nWhat if we detect themes that are not related with each other? Do we include data that don’t fit anywhere else or if they are trivial we can exclude them from the final It depends on how you identify your themes - they may be strongly related to each other and hierarchical and they may not. There is no one correct way. In the report writing guide, we ask that you report a maximum of two themes (or one theme with 2-3 subthemes) so I would choose those where you would be able to go into the most depth in terms of interpretation report?"
