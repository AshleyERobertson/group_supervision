    "text": "Overview\nI initially designed this resource to help structure my group supervision sessions, and have now set it up as an online book to share with others. It’s written for supervisors as an audience, rather than for students.\nThere are a range of different resources contained within this book. In the section below, I give an overview of how I supervise and how my group supervision is structured. In the chapters that follow, I break down, week-by-week, what I cover along with the resources I use.\nIf you are interested in using any of these resources, please do! Feel free to pick and choose/adapt any of the resources, incorporating what you want into your own supervision practice.\nWhere there are internal resources that I’ve used, I’ve either linked to the original source or have said who the resource has come from. Depending on the source, these may or may not be available if you are external to the University of Glasgow. Saying that, I’ve made as many available as possible. Where there are external resources, I’ve provided the original source.\nEach chapter (or week) tends to be structured as follows:"

    "section": "How I structure my supervision",
    "text": "How I structure my supervision\nThe way I run my dissertation supervision is:\n\nLevel 4 students have a combination of individual supervision and group supervision (switching between each on a weekly basis). I, personally, like having both types rather than just doing group or individual.\nPGT ODL students have individual supervision (30 mins) on a fortnightly basis (this is because they are part-time and online distance-learning). I also hold a couple of group sessions through the year to get them in touch with each other so they can provide peer support, although many work full-time or in schools etc., which combined with time zones, makes it difficult to find a time to suit everyone. I record these so everyone can benefit.\n\nTherefore, most of these resources apply to my UG dissertation students, but could easily be applied to PGT, especially those studying on campus.\n\nSetting expectations with students\nIn 23-24, I made up sways to detail the supervision process for both Level 4 students and ODL students. They were well-received, but the students who went out of their way to tell me that they found it helpful were those who were neurodivergent, as it meant they knew what to expect. I think they would also be quite helpful for international students, as previous supervision experiences at university might have been very different.\nI’ve linked to examples of the sways above (please feel free to duplicate for your own use), but have also included the content in Appendix A\n\n\nJoint deadline document\nI use a deadline document for each cohort of supervisees. This details deadlines (I keep them as soft deadlines, but others might decide to do hard deadlines) and also notes when each draft was received and when I returned feedback.\nIt means I can keep on top of a) where each student is in the process, b) the order in which I receive sections (and therefore have to give feedback), and c) allows students to know where their draft is in the ‘queue’ (which might reduce unrealistic expectations of a return within a short timescale!). I allow students to view the spreadsheet but they are not able to edit it, meaning they can’t change a deadline without talking to me about it.\nExamples of deadline documents:\n\nLevel 4 students deadline document\nPGT ODL students deadline document\n\n\n\n‘Themed’ supervision\nI’ve taken an approach of doing themed sessions in supervision, covering things that everyone will need to know about and also incorporating the dissemination of resources for students. Some of these are resources I made up, some are resources from UoG SPaN staff members and others are from external sources.\nStudents have said they’ve found the resources helpful and have applied them to some of their other courses. I used to have the group sessions in the even weeks, but then some students go away for reading week, so I’ve moved them to the odd weeks.\nThe below structure is based on a dissertation starting in September (Semester 1 Week 1) and ending in mid-March (Semester 2 Week 10). This is likely to differ based on discipline and University.\nLevel 4 group supervision is as follows:\n\nSemester 1 Week 1 - Getting to know each other, topics, proposals\n\nSemester 1 Week 3 - Ethics, research questions\n\nSemester 1 Week 5 - Summarising papers, writing, bullet point introductions\n\nSemester 1 Week 7 - Discussing the bullet point intros (students to bring bullet point intros), participant recruitment, reducing perfectionism\n\nSemester 1 Week 9 - Collecting data, developing evaluation (intro)\n\nSemester 1 Week 11 - Structure (i.e. reverse outlines), JARS guidelines\nSemester 2 Week 1 - Receiving and applying feedback, presenting work\nSemester 2 Week 3 - Analysis (quant and qual) - students to bring questions\nSemester 2 Week 5 - Developing evaluation (discussion), peer review of discussion\nSemester 2 Week 7 - No-stakes presentations - all students will present a 5 min summary of study findings so far\nSemester 2 Week 9 - Final group session - students to bring questions\nSemester 2 Week 11 - LONGER SESSION - celebration and practice talks for UG conference/BPS. Students to bring presentation slides\n\nAlthough dissertation hand-in is the Friday of Semester 2 Week 10 and so supervision has technically ended, as students were anxious about presenting their research I held an extra group session in Week 11 so they could do practice talks a few days before the UG conference. I will keep this for future years as students reported finding it supportive.\nI do individual supervision in the even weeks, and do 30 mins per person. Other models that supervisors use is to do group supervision every week or some do one week group supervision, one week drop-in."

I have some below, but in our first group meeting, I will ask you to think about whether there are any you would like to add, or if there is anything you want to amend related to the points below.\n\nA.2.1 Communication\nI ask that all students working with me communicate with me, letting me know if they are unable to make a certain deadline or if something gets in the way of a task they had planned for a specific point in time. In return, I will communicate with you regularly, including when you can expect feedback, and will do my best to let you know if I have to delay something beyond what I had previously communicated.\n\n\nA.2.2 Attendance\nI ask that all students attend group sessions unless there is something urgent that has come up. Individual sessions are more flexible and can be cancelled if you feel that you don’t need to meet in a particular week (although please let me know in advance if this is the case). Group sessions are held for 1h every fortnight, with individual sessions being 30 mins, held in the weeks that we are not meeting as a group.\n\n\nA.2.3 Supportive space\nI want the dissertation group to be an encouraging, safe, space and the dissertation process to be an enjoyable (albeit challenging at points!) experience for everyone. This means that you should never hesitate to ask any questions (all questions are valid) and I’d like us all to work together to support each other. No one is perfect and we will all make mistakes during the process (including me). I’ve been supervising for quite a few years now and I haven’t yet managed to come across anything that we have been unable to sort after some discussion, so don’t worry about talking to me if something has gone wrong :)."

I will ask you to work with me to set these deadlines so that we agree them together.\n\nA.4.1 Ethics\nWe will prioritise the ethics application from the very start - the reason for this is that you cannot recruit data unless you have your ethics approved, meaning that delayed applications can bring a project to a halt.\n\n\nA.4.2 Dissertation\nDissertation section deadlines are not set in stone - I would much rather that you take an extra day or two if you need it rather than sending an unfinished draft (with the caveat that it will never be perfect). If this is the case, let me know and we can discuss options.\nAlthough it is unusual for this to be an issue, there will be a point where I am no longer able to look over drafts before the deadline. We will aim for dates before this, but my cut-off is that I don’t accept drafts once we reach 1st March. This is because it becomes very unlikely that I will be able to turn around feedback in time for you to be able to make meaningful changes by the submission .deadline in mid-March."

For dissertation section drafts, I will usually aim to provide feedback within two weeks. This is because drafts tend to be in semester 2, when I have most of my teaching. Depending on my teaching/marking commitments, this may take longer, but I will communicate with you about this at the time. You will also be able to see where you are in the ‘feedback queue’ in the shared deadlines document.\n\n\nA.6.2 What type of feedback you will receive\nI generally provide in-text comments, so that I can show you which part am I referring to in my feedback (where relevant). I will also give a global overview/summary. I will tend to focus on what can be improved, as this is the priority to help your writing develop. However, I will also let you know what you do well too.\n\n\nA.6.3 How you can ask for specific feedback\nIf you have specific parts you would like feedback on (e.g. if you are unsure about something), you can leave comments in your document (either at specific points or at the start) and I will respond to them when I am reading through. Try not to put the points you’d like feedback on in the message when you send the file to me, as I put the files elsewhere and don’t tend to refer back to messages. This makes it more likely that I’ll miss them if they aren’t contained in the document when I come to read it.\n\n\nA.6.4 What format should be sent for the drafts?\nAll documents (proposal, ethics, Intro, Methods, Results/Analysis) should be in Word. An exception to this is copies of standardised measures (this might be in pdf, which is fine)."

Here, we will tend to catch up on how your project is going, and you will have the opportunity to ask questions. These may be used more often at certain points in the year (e.g. getting ethics together) than others (e.g. once your data collection is all set up).\nMost people come along every week, but if you find one week that you don’t need to meet, it’s not an issue - just let me know and we can cancel it."

If the bullet point intros take longer than expected, I’ll pass the resources on to the students to review outside the session.\n\n4.1.1 Expected progress\n\nAround now, I would expect most ethics applications to be submitted (or in the final stages of draft) (especially if it’s going through College rather than the intranet)\nStudents will have made a rough outline of their introduction and will have done background reading\nI will usually ask students to pick a deadline for their Introduction around now, adding it to the shared deadlines spreadsheet\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Bullet point introductions\n\nWe then spend most of the session discussing the bullet point introductions.\n\nEach person talks about their project and what they currently think about for their introduction in terms of structure\nI will then give some feedback on these and students can also ask questions etc.\nIt’s quite a good opportunity for the whole group to understand what everyone is doing for their project\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Participant recruitment\n\nIf we have time, I will cover participant recruitment first, then reducing perfectionism\n\nWhat are students’ plans for recruitment?\nDo they foresee any difficulties? If so, is there anything we can put in place now to mitigate these?\nThings to think about:\n\nWhat are the backup plans? What if the students need to recruit more people?\nAre any gatekeepers needed?\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Reducing perfectionism\n\nI talk about perfectionism and how it can be quite a big barrier in terms of not wanting to ‘let go’ of things\n\nRemind students that a draft is just that: a draft. It’s not the final version and doesn’t need to be seen by anyone else.\n\nI talk about my own experiences of it as a student and what I found helped me:\n\nBreaking things into small chunks\nReminding myself that feedback will help make it stronger in the end\n\nI tend to add the below external resources to Teams and let students engage with them if they want"

Other supervisors may differ on this, but it’s caused issues in the past (see examples above).\n\nStudents need Emily’s extended debrief if going to recruit Level 1 students\nSONA is used to recruit Level 1 students (students should see Emily’s sway on how to do this)\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Data Collection (Qual projects)\n\nHow are students collecting data?\n\nIf online, must use GDPR-approved system (e.g. Zoom or Teams)\nIf in person, will need a) appropriate recording equipment, b) a quiet space\n\nSome supervisors differ on their opinions on this, but I ask students to send out questions in advance for all participants, as it can be more accessible for certain people (e.g. those who are neurodivergent or who don’t speak English as a first language)\nI ask students how they are feeling about collecting data. Typically, they can be a bit nervous\n\nImportant to practise setting things up/recording etc.\nGood to pilot things (e.g. with a friend). I’m also happy to help in office hours etc.\nCan practise with each other (i.e. others in the group) to help get comfortable\nCan be helpful to write a list of everything need to cover at the start and end so that they don’t forget anything\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Evaluation in introductions\nIn RM2, Wil and I have made some excerpts from intros and discussions for our labs. In today’s session, I only cover intros and do discussions in a later session.\nHere, I show the students the poor and stronger versions and we then have a discussion about it (slides with notes).

It’s good to touch base and see where everyone is at in their projects, as things tend to start winding down (especially recruitment-wise) for the festive period.\nIn this session, I cover structure (specifically thinking about reverse outlines, so that larger structure of a document) and we also discuss the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS).\nI tend to reiterate to the students how important it is to get some rest over Christmas, and what they are looking forward to in Semester 2. I also mention the BPS conference and ask them to have a think about presenting there next semester.\n\n6.1.1 Expected progress\n\nI may have seen a few intros at this point, but it’s likely students are still working on these.\nSome students will usually have started data collection.\nHopefully all ethical approvals should be back by now\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Structure\n\nI mainly cover structure between paragraphs rather than within them here, but if you wanted to cover structure in a paragraph, there are some useful resources on PEEL in Chapter 20.2 of the Research Methods 1 book.\nI use the Reverse Outlines resource to discuss reviewing structure of a particular section (e.g. the Introduction)\nSome things we discuss:\n\na broad –&gt; narrow structure can be helpful for the introduction (and the reverse for the discussion)\nare you covering one main point per paragraph or trying to squeeze too many in?\ntry to think about the reader when writing - what do they know at each point?\ndoes your reverse outline make sense? For example, does it jump around between topics or does the structure flow clearly?\nif covering quite disjointed topics in the intro, it might be worth considering using sub-headings\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) and other resources\n\nIn the second half of the session, we cover JARS guidelines. These are very useful, particularly for the methods sections and often results too (there tends to be less guidance on intro/discussion).\nThe guidelines give some insight into what students might want to include, and has some suggestions for people who would be reviewing an article (i.e. what might they look for) which are useful to know\n\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Qual)\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Quant)\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Mixed Methods)\n\nIn addition, there have been Journal Article Reporting Standards for Race, Ethnicity, and Culture released\n\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Race, Ethnicity and Culture)\n\nAs most of my research has been in autism, if I have any students working on this topic, I share a resource by Bottema-Beutel et al (2021) on avoiding ableist language"

Although it can be anxiety provoking, it helps equip them with useful employability skills\nI then highlight the Level 4 conference at the end of the semester, and the BPS conference that is usually at the end of March/beginning of April. I tell students that to support these, we will a) practice running through findings in the group (week 7) and we will b) book out a room to do a proper practice with slides (week 11). Both of these are no stakes and the purpose is to help students practice communicating their research in a safe environment.\nWe then discuss some of my tips for this (caveat: others may disagree) and together we plan out some concrete actions of what they could do to improve their experiences of presenting."

I think I had a mixture of ones that students had posted on teams (with me saying I’d answer in the group session) and others that were asked only in the session.\nThe students found it a useful experience, even if they hadn’t thought much about it as those who were a bit further behind got answers to questions they hadn’t thought of yet.\n\n\n8.1.3 Qual resource\nFor any qual students, I give them Activity 2 from Lab 9 in RM2, and ask them what they think about the depth.\n\n\n8.1.4 Quant resource\nFor any quant students, I remind them about the PsyTeachR resources.

Over the past few years, I’ve had students find the MSc Conversion book useful, in particular,\n\n\n8.1.5 Looking over excerpts of results/analysis\n\nBefore the session, I will have prepared some results/analysis extracts from previous dissertations. I then give these out during the session and we discuss:\n\nwhat they liked/what worked well\n\nwhat they felt could be improved\none concrete thing that they might take forward when they come to write their own analysis section\n\n\n\nI also flag that these are not all A1 examples. The stuednts usually say they are surprised by how different they are, and this leads to a discussion about key things being covered but it’s not ‘one size fits all’."
