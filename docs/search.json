    "section": "How I structure my supervision",
    "text": "How I structure my supervision\nThe way I run my dissertation supervision is:\n\nLevel 4 students have a combination of individual supervision and group supervision (switching between each on a weekly basis). I, personally, like having both types rather than just doing group or individual.\nPGT ODL students have individual supervision (30 mins) on a fortnightly basis (this is because they are part-time and online distance-learning). I also hold a couple of group sessions through the year to get them in touch with each other so they can provide peer support, although many work full-time or in schools etc., which combined with time zones, makes it difficult to find a time to suit everyone. I record these so everyone can benefit.\n\nTherefore, most of these resources apply to my UG dissertation students, but could easily be applied to PGT, especially those studying on campus.\n\nSetting expectations with students\nIn 23-24, I made up sways to detail the supervision process for both Level 4 students and ODL students. They were well-received, but the students who went out of their way to tell me that they found it helpful were those who were neurodivergent, as it meant they knew what to expect. I think they would also be quite helpful for international students, as previous supervision experiences at university might have been very different.\nI’ve linked to examples of the sways above (please feel free to duplicate for your own use), but have also included the content in Appendix A\n\n\nJoint deadline document\nI use a deadline document for each cohort of supervisees. This details deadlines (I keep them as soft deadlines, but others might decide to do hard deadlines) and also notes when each draft was received and when I returned feedback.\nIt means I can keep on top of a) where each student is in the process, b) the order in which I receive sections (and therefore have to give feedback), and c) allows students to know where their draft is in the ‘queue’ (which might reduce unrealistic expectations of a return within a short timescale!). I allow students to view the spreadsheet but they are not able to edit it, meaning they can’t change a deadline without talking to me about it.\nExamples of deadline documents:\n\nLevel 4 students deadline document\nPGT ODL students deadline document\n\n\n\n‘Themed’ supervision\nI’ve taken an approach of doing themed sessions in supervision, covering things that everyone will need to know about and also incorporating the dissemination of resources for students. Some of these are resources I made up, some are resources from UoG SPaN staff members and others are from external sources.\nStudents have said they’ve found the resources helpful and have applied them to some of their other courses. I used to have the group sessions in the even weeks, but then some students go away for reading week, so I’ve moved them to the odd weeks.\nThe below structure is based on a dissertation starting in September (Semester 1 Week 1) and ending in mid-March (Semester 2 Week 10). This is likely to differ based on discipline and University.\nLevel 4 group supervision is as follows:\n\nSemester 1 Week 1 - Getting to know each other, topics, proposals\n\nSemester 1 Week 3 - Ethics, research questions\n\nSemester 1 Week 5 - Summarising papers, writing, bullet point introductions\n\nSemester 1 Week 7 - Discussing the bullet point intros (students to bring bullet point intros), participant recruitment, reducing perfectionism\n\nSemester 1 Week 9 - Collecting data, developing evaluation (intro)\n\nSemester 1 Week 11 - Structure (i.e. reverse outlines), JARS guidelines\nSemester 2 Week 1 - Receiving and applying feedback, presenting work\nSemester 2 Week 3 - Analysis (quant and qual) - students to bring questions\nSemester 2 Week 5 - Developing evaluation (discussion), peer review of discussion\nSemester 2 Week 7 - No-stakes presentations - all students will present a 5 min summary of study findings so far\nSemester 2 Week 9 - Final group session - students to bring questions\nSemester 2 Week 11 - LONGER SESSION - celebration and practice talks for UG conference/BPS. Students to bring presentation slides\n\nAlthough dissertation hand-in is the Friday of Semester 2 Week 10 and so supervision has technically ended, as students were anxious about presenting their research I held an extra group session in Week 11 so they could do practice talks a few days before the UG conference. I will keep this for future years as students reported finding it supportive.\nI do individual supervision in the even weeks, and do 30 mins per person. Other models that supervisors use is to do group supervision every week or some do one week group supervision, one week drop-in."

    "text": "1.1 Getting to know each other, topics, proposals\nIn the first session, the purpose is mainly to get to know each other - what topics are students interested in? We also have a look over what is required for the dissertation proposal and discuss what they can expect as part of supervision.\n\n1.1.1 Introductions and topics\n\nEveryone introduces themselves and the general topic/s that they are interested in. Do they have a fixed idea or are they still deciding? Do they know what approach they want to take, methodologically? Do they have any questions?\n\n\n\n1.1.2 Format of supervision\n\nI then discuss the general process of supervision\n\nExpectations I have (stated in the sway) and what students can expect from me\nIndividual vs. group sessions (including how these differ, what the function of each is)\nExplain the importance of getting ethics done at an early stage in the process\nDiscuss a general timeline of the project (everyone’s will look a bit different though)\n\nTypically, intros are sent in December/early Jan, methods in Jan/Feb and Results or Analysis in Feb.\n\nSections can be sent together or separately.\n\nEveryone should choose deadlines for each section and it will be added to the deadline spreadsheet.\n\nI have a cut off for accepting drafts. This is usually two weeks before the deadline, so students should keep this in mind when setting deadlines (they should give themselves some wiggle room).\n\n\nShow the students the folder with dissertation resources I’ve gathered together. This will be everything covered in the group sessions, plus anything else that’s useful\n\nShow students the spreadsheet to track drafts etc. We’ll discuss possible deadlines in individual supervision\nThey will have to juggle the dissertation alongside other courses, so will need to work consistently on it but also take advantage of the quieter periods to work on it.\n\nSome things I cover, in terms of project management:\n\nIt’s worth setting up a reference manager now if they don’t already use one (e.g. Zotero)\nProject management will be very important - there’s information on using Planner in the Moodle\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Writing a proposal\nDifferent supervisors have different ways of approaching the proposal - as most of the students working with me tend to do somewhat sensitive topics, I am very mindful of not delaying ethics too much and therefore ask them to work on the proposal and also make a start on ethics pretty soon after. But, they would need to have a very clear idea of the project and how they were going to set it up in this case.\nSome things I discuss with students and ask them to think about:\n\nWhy are they conducting the study?\nWhat do they want to find out? - What data will they need?\nWho are they going to recruit? From where?\nWhat would your RQ/hypotheses be?\nIf quant, what analysis would you do for each hypothesis?\nIf qual, how are you planning to analyse your data and why?\n\nI also direct the students to the information on proposal writing on the Moodle (Level 4 Undergraduate)\n\n\n1.1.4 Other things to cover\n\nI show the students where the Level 4 moodle is (usually there are at least a few who aren’t aware of this)\nI introduce the idea of deciding between College vs. intranet for ethics (will depend on their project)\nMention that one things I’m doing is building up a bank of data that future students can use. Ideally, I would like all projects that collect data to have an option in it for storage of the data and keeping it so students can analyse it in the future."

There is more wiggle room if supervisors are supervising low-risk/secondary projects.\n\n2.1.1 Expected progress\n\nIn Week 3, I would expect that students are firming up their research questions and what their data collection/analysis will look like and have made progress in the proposal.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Research Questions\n\nI usually talk through some tips for developing a Research Question (quant and qual) as well as hypotheses (quant only), using resources from RM1 and RM2 (MSc Conversion courses) see internal resources below.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Ethics\n\nGenerally I will aim for ethics to be submitted around Week 6 (final submission, not submission to supervisor)\n\nGiven this, when will we set as a deadline to get an initial first draft of ethics to supervisor? This date is then added to the spreadsheet for each student. Need to allow time for supervisor comments and student time to act on feedback.\n\nMay need multiple drafts before ready to submit.\n\nWhat concerns do students have about ethics?\n\nDiscuss whether each project is likely to be secondary ethics, intranet ethics (low-risk option for Level 4 only) or College ethics (higher-risk/potential to publish for Level 4, all primary data collection for PGT) so students are clear on what they are expected to do.\n\nI will then ask students to make sure that they use the resources linked on the moodle for their ethics (templates and examples are available) and show them where this is.\n\nThere is one final resource available to them: commented versions of ethics applications from previous student projects (one quant and one qual)."

I usually have both quant and qual projects so cover both types of data collection - I would only cover one though, if students were only doing one type. We then cover evaluation in Intros using some resources that Wil and I developed for our Research Methods 2 course. (Discussions are covered in Semester 2 Week 5)\nAlthough I cover data collection in Week 7 (if I have time), that was an initial discussion to put it at the forefront of their minds and this is more in-depth, as they should be close to having ethics approved if they don’t already.\n\n5.1.1 Expected progress\n\nBy now, ethics approvals should be imminent or through already\nSome students may have already started data collection, or might be getting materials together in anticipation of starting\nIf doing secondary data analysis, the timeline is a bit less pressured\nStudents should be working on introductions\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Data Collection (Quant projects)\n(N.B. I only supervise survey-based quant projects, so my notes refer to this only)\n\nHow is data going to be collected (e.g. Qualtrics, experimentum?). Student should use university email, not personal email for account.\n\nEven if ethics isn’t through yet, can still familiarise themselves with it.\n\nAre students clear on how to present their study on whichever system they are using?\nTest, test and test again\n\nIt’s important to make sure that scales are presented correctly. I’ve had one student have to start from scratch before because they put Strongly Agree - Disagree - neither agree nor disagree - Agree - Strongly Disagree and only noticed mid-way through data collection\nWe also had one project where the participants saw a picture and it wasn’t clear from the data which picture was presented (and it was the between subjects condition) and she had to start data collection again.\nI emphasise to students that they should not start data collection without extensive testing and I reiterate to let me know when it is ready for me to look over. Other supervisors may differ on this, but it’s caused issues in the past (see examples above).\n\nStudents need Emily’s extended debrief if going to recruit Level 1 students\nSONA is used to recruit Level 1 students (students should see Emily’s sway on how to do this)\n\n\n\n5.1.3 Data Collection (Qual projects)\n\nHow are students collecting data?\n\nIf online, must use GDPR-approved system (e.g. Zoom or Teams)\nIf in person, will need a) appropriate recording equipment, b) a quiet space\n\nSome supervisors differ on their opinions on this, but I ask students to send out questions in advance for all participants, as it can be more accessible for certain people (e.g. those who are neurodivergent or who don’t speak English as a first language)\nI ask students how they are feeling about collecting data. Typically, they can be a bit nervous\n\nImportant to practise setting things up/recording etc.\nGood to pilot things (e.g. with a friend). I’m also happy to help in office hours etc.\nCan practise with each other (i.e. others in the group) to help get comfortable\nCan be helpful to write a list of everything need to cover at the start and end so that they don’t forget anything\n\n\n\n\n5.1.4 Evaluation in introductions\nIn RM2, Wil and I have made some excerpts from intros and discussions for our labs. In today’s session, I only cover intros and do discussions in a later session.\nHere, I show the students the poor and stronger versions and we then have a discussion about it (slides with notes).\nThis resource has ‘not so good’ examples, then ‘stronger’ examples and then notes for things to look out for and finally some tips.\nThe three things we look at are:\n\nSynthesising evidence\nFocused criticism\nWhy is your study worth doing?"

These are very useful, particularly for the methods sections and often results too (there tends to be less guidance on intro/discussion).\nThe guidelines give some insight into what students might want to include, and has some suggestions for people who would be reviewing an article (i.e. what might they look for) which are useful to know\n\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Qual)\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Quant)\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Mixed Methods)\n\nIn addition, there have been Journal Article Reporting Standards for Race, Ethnicity, and Culture released\n\nJournal Article Reporting Standards (Race, Ethnicity and Culture)\n\nAs most of my research has been in autism, if I have any students working on this topic, I share a resource by Bottema-Beutel et al (2021) on avoiding ableist language"

Although it can be anxiety provoking, it helps equip them with useful employability skills\nI then highlight the Level 4 conference at the end of the semester, and the BPS conference that is usually at the end of March/beginning of April. I tell students that to support these, we will a) practice running through findings in the group (week 7) and we will b) book out a room to do a proper practice with slides (week 11). Both of these are no stakes and the purpose is to help students practice communicating their research in a safe environment.\nWe then discuss some of my tips for this (caveat: others may disagree) and together we plan out some concrete actions of what they could do to improve their experiences of presenting."

We can’t cover it all, so I tend to show students some parts of how to practically apply feedback in group supervision and we discuss it (e.g. SNOB analysis in the Salford document, Action Planning in the ’AdvanceHE Student Guide).\nI always highlight that they are in fourth year and so will be used to applying feedback, but that it can be useful to consider how they might further improve things.\nHepplestone et al., 2010\nHEAdvance resource, August 2012\nSalford Uni resource\nPortsmouth Uni have some useful tips on presenting for students"

Discussing these questions takes up most of the session.\nIn the rest of the session, I cover the following: a) if I have some students doing qual, I cover an example of getting depth in analysis, b) I remind students doing quant about the PsyTeachR resources and c) I provide some excerpts of Results/Analysis sections from previous student work (all anonmyised) and give these to the students to have a look at. The last one tends to generate a bit of discussion.\n\n8.1.1 Expected progress\n\nI would be expecting all intros to be submitted by this point, plus to have had a few methods submitted\nData collection should be wrapping up imminently if not already completed\nStudents should be writing up Methods if not yet submitted\nThose doing qual projects should be working on transcripts and have a cut-off for recruitment/data collection\nThose doing quant projects should be working on setting up their .rmd and getting set up for analysis\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Questions\nMost of today’s group session will be answering questions from students on analysis. I think I had a mixture of ones that students had posted on teams (with me saying I’d answer in the group session) and others that were asked only in the session.\nThe students found it a useful experience, even if they hadn’t thought much about it as those who were a bit further behind got answers to questions they hadn’t thought of yet.\n\n\n8.1.3 Qual resource\nFor any qual students, I give them Activity 2 from Lab 9 in RM2, and ask them what they think about the depth.\n\n\n8.1.4 Quant resource\nFor any quant students, I remind them about the PsyTeachR resources. Although they will be aware of the books they had in Levels 1 through 3, they will be less likely to know about the MSc resources. Over the past few years, I’ve had students find the MSc Conversion book useful, in particular,\n\n\n8.1.5 Looking over excerpts of results/analysis\n\nBefore the session, I will have prepared some results/analysis extracts from previous dissertations. I then give these out during the session and we discuss:\n\nwhat they liked/what worked well\n\nwhat they felt could be improved\none concrete thing that they might take forward when they come to write their own analysis section\n\n\n\nI also flag that these are not all A1 examples. The stuednts usually say they are surprised by how different they are, and this leads to a discussion about key things being covered but it’s not ‘one size fits all’."

In return, I will communicate with you regularly, including when you can expect feedback, and will do my best to let you know if I have to delay something beyond what I had previously communicated.\n\n\nA.2.2 Attendance\nI ask that all students attend group sessions unless there is something urgent that has come up. Individual sessions are more flexible and can be cancelled if you feel that you don’t need to meet in a particular week (although please let me know in advance if this is the case). Group sessions are held for 1h every fortnight, with individual sessions being 30 mins, held in the weeks that we are not meeting as a group.\n\n\nA.2.3 Supportive space\nI want the dissertation group to be an encouraging, safe, space and the dissertation process to be an enjoyable (albeit challenging at points!) experience for everyone. This means that you should never hesitate to ask any questions (all questions are valid) and I’d like us all to work together to support each other. No one is perfect and we will all make mistakes during the process (including me).

If this is the case, let me know and we can discuss options.\nAlthough it is unusual for this to be an issue, there will be a point where I am no longer able to look over drafts before the deadline.

Depending on my teaching/marking commitments, this may take longer, but I will communicate with you about this at the time. You will also be able to see where you are in the ‘feedback queue’ in the shared deadlines document.\n\n\nA.6.2 What type of feedback you will receive\nI generally provide in-text comments, so that I can show you which part am I referring to in my feedback (where relevant). I will also give a global overview/summary. I will tend to focus on what can be improved, as this is the priority to help your writing develop. However, I will also let you know what you do well too.\n\n\nA.6.3 How you can ask for specific feedback\nIf you have specific parts you would like feedback on (e.g. if you are unsure about something), you can leave comments in your document (either at specific points or at the start) and I will respond to them when I am reading through. Try not to put the points you’d like feedback on in the message when you send the file to me, as I put the files elsewhere and don’t tend to refer back to messages. This makes it more likely that I’ll miss them if they aren’t contained in the document when I come to read it.\n\n\nA.6.4 What format should be sent for the drafts?\nAll documents (proposal, ethics, Intro, Methods, Results/Analysis) should be in Word. An exception to this is copies of standardised measures (this might be in pdf, which is fine)."
