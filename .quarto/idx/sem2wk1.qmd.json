I cover receiving and applying feedback in this session, as well as presentation research.\n\nAt the end of the session, I tell students that the next group session is on analysis and ask them to bring any questions they have in for the session so we can cover them together.\n\n### Expected progress\n\n-   Students should have submitted or be not too far off submitting a draft of the Introduction for feedback. They should also be working on their Methods.\n-   Students should be recruiting participants by now\n\n### Receiving and applying feedback\n\n-   As part of the group session, I talk about [the type of feedback I give](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/Ead4D1hp_7FOi4TlUVQA_O4B9dZcvARaCYuyIWtw3uO0MA?e=K2rR0W) (i.e. what students can expect when they receive feedback from me).\n-   I also tell them how they can get the most out of the feedback that I give (e.g. asking questions after receiving it, leaving comments in their work for me to respond to)\n-   This will be individual to each supervisor, but I've provided a summary of what I discuss with the students below. I don't give them this, but it has the main things I talk about in the discussion.\n-   I cover a few, select, parts of the external resources linked below and we discuss how they might be able to apply these to their work in semester 2.\n\n### Presentations\n\n-   I've noticed that quite a few students I supervise are nervous about presenting, so I talk to them about how they feel about it.\n-   We discuss presenting their dissertation research, and I encourage them to take the opportunity to present when they get it. Although it can be anxiety provoking, it helps equip them with useful employability skills\n-   I then highlight the Level 4 conference at the end of the semester, and the BPS conference that is usually at the end of March/beginning of April. I tell students that to support these, we will a) practice running through findings in the group (week 7) and we will b) book out a room to do a proper practice with slides (week 11). Both of these are no stakes and the purpose is to help students practice communicating their research in a safe environment.\n-   We then discuss [some of my tips](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EQh-1I7HCsBGkpcK6WmxPUUB_7JmqoRw1LINLhLWATig6w?e=veACdI) for this (caveat: others may disagree) and together we plan out some concrete actions of what they could do to improve their experiences of presenting.\n\n## Internal resources\n\n[Guidance on the type of feedback I tend to give for dissertations](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/Ead4D1hp_7FOi4TlUVQA_O4B9dZcvARaCYuyIWtw3uO0MA?e=K2rR0W)\n\n[Guidance on presentations](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EQh-1I7HCsBGkpcK6WmxPUUB_7JmqoRw1LINLhLWATig6w?e=2AYZfm)\n\n[Useful resources on feedback](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=4529&section=5) in the Psychology & Neuroscience General Information moodle, including a [Feedback and Study Guide](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=1076576).\n\n## Extenal resources\n\nThere are a few useful resources targeted at helping students get the most from feedback.
