Although they will be aware of the books they had in Levels 1 through 3, they will be less likely to know about the MSc resources. Over the past few years, I've had students find the [MSc Conversion book](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v3/) useful, in particular,\n\n### Looking over excerpts of results/analysis\n\n-   Before the session, I will have prepared some results/analysis extracts from previous dissertations. I then give these out during the session and we discuss:\n    -   what they liked/what worked well\n        -   what they felt could be improved\n        -   one concrete thing that they might take forward when they come to write their own analysis section\n\nI also flag that these are not all A1 examples. The stuednts usually say they are surprised by how different they are, and this leads to a discussion about key things being covered but it's not 'one size fits all'.\n\n## Internal resources\n\n### Quantitative resources (PsyTeachR)\n\n[Activity 2 from Lab 9 in RM2](https://wtoivo.github.io/RM2-F2F-quali-book/labs.html#lab-9-activity-2-going-deeper-in-your-analysis)\n\n[Level 1 data skills](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v2/)\n\n[Level 2 data skills](https://psyteachr.github.io/analysis-v2/)\n\n[Level 3 data skills](https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v1/)\n\n[MSc Conv (RM1/RM2)](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v3/)\n\n[MSc RMOPS (Data Skills for Reporoducible Research)](https://psyteachr.github.io/reprores-v3/)\n\n### Qualitative resources (Research Methods 2 (F2F and ODL))\n\n[Activity 2 from Lab 9 in RM2](https://ashleyerobertson.github.io/RM2_F2F_quali_book_v4/01_labs.html#week-9-lab-8-analysis-coding)\n\n[MSc Conv (RM2)](https://ashleyerobertson.github.io/RM2_F2F_quali_book_v4)\n\n[MSc Conv ODL (RM2 ODL)](https://ashleyerobertson.github.io/RM2_ODL_quali_book_v4)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Analysis (quant and qual)\n\nIn the previous session, I would have ended the group meeting by asking students to bring in their analysis questions.
