## Discussing the bullet point intros, participant recruitment, reducing perfectionism 

In this session, we go through everyone's bullet point intros. These are usually between half a page and a full page of A4, and don't need to be concrete.

We'll then cover participant recruitment. If we have time, we'll look at reducing perfectionism and discuss this as a group. If the bullet point intros take longer than expected, I'll pass the resources on to the students to review outside the session.

### Expected progress

-   Around now, I would expect most ethics applications to be submitted (or in the final stages of draft) (especially if it's going through College rather than the intranet)
-   Students will have made a rough outline of their introduction and will have done background reading
-   I will usually ask students to pick a deadline for their Introduction around now, adding it to the shared deadlines spreadsheet

### Bullet point introductions

-   We then spend most of the session discussing the bullet point introductions.
    -   Each person talks about their project and what they currently think about for their introduction in terms of structure
    -   I will then give some feedback on these and students can also ask questions etc.
    -   It's quite a good opportunity for the whole group to understand what everyone is doing for their project

### Participant recruitment

-   If we have time, I will cover participant recruitment first, then reducing perfectionism
    -   What are students' plans for recruitment?
    -   Do they foresee any difficulties? If so, is there anything we can put in place now to mitigate these?
    -   Things to think about:
        -   What are the backup plans? What if the students need to recruit more people?
        -   Are any gatekeepers needed?

### Reducing perfectionism

-   I talk about perfectionism and how it can be quite a big barrier in terms of not wanting to 'let go' of things
    -   Remind students that a draft is just that: a draft. It's not the final version and doesn't need to be seen by anyone else.
-   I talk about my own experiences of it as a student and what I found helped me:
    -   Breaking things into small chunks
    -   Reminding myself that feedback will help make it stronger in the end
-   I tend to add the below external resources to Teams and let students engage with them if they want

## External resources

Dr Carolina Kuepper-Tetzel found these resources on [Perfection Paralysis](https://hiddencurriculum.ca/wp-content/uploads/articulate_uploads/perfection-paralysis/index.html#/lessons/hAZjtzG_2XP4B6Quwveg8YvAI2zRrlqi) on the [Hidden Curriclum website](https://hiddencurriculum.ca/) (contains lots of useful resources)
