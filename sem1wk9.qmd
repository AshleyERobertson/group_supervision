## Collecting data, developing evaluation for the introduction

In this session, I tend to cover data collection (i.e. trying to pre-empt any issues before they happen) and also developing evaluation of the Introduction section. I usually have both quant and qual projects so cover both types of data collection - I would only cover one though, if students were only doing one type. We then cover evaluation in Intros using some resources that Wil and I developed for our Research Methods 2 course. (Discussions are covered in Semester 2 Week 5 **ADD LINK**)

Although I cover data collection in Week 7 (if I have time), that was an initial discussion to put it at the forefront of their minds and this is more in-depth, as they should be close to having ethics approved if they don't already. 

### How are projects going?

-   I usually check how everyone is getting on 
    - By now, I would be expecting to see some ethics drafts coming in and all projects should be firmed up. Rationales should all be submitted.
