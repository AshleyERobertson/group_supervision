## Developing evaluation in the discussion, peer review of discussion

In this session, we concentrate mainly on Discussion sections. I cover evaluation using the resources from the RM2 lab (Introductions were covered in [Semester 1 Week 9](https://ashleyerobertson.github.io/group_supervision/sem1wk9.html)). We then use this as jumping off point to talk about their Discussions. We then discuss peer review of Discussing sections.

At the end of the session, I remind students that the next group session will be no-stakes presentations on their initial findings (no need to have completed analysis). There are no slides and they should prepare to talk for 5 mins.

### Expected progress

-   By week 5, projects should be finished in terms of data collection and analysis ongoing
-   I would be expecting Methods sections to be submitted by now (unless the student is submitting it alongside results/analysis)

### Evaluation in discussions

-   Here, I show the students the poor and stronger versions of [excerpts within Discussions](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/Eb-chzz3EvJIoBK5TA5SVPABtu8PhcfmV91U9FaehaGhFg?e=6UBAyc) and we then have a chat about what they think. The three things we look at are:
    -   Linking findings to the evidence base
        -   i.e. where students link to the evidence base but only say if it agrees/disagrees, rather than going further
    -   Limitations
        -   including quantitative limitations,
        -   covering lots of different limitations but not going into depth
    -   Implications
        -   not linking to the evidence base in support
        -   over-inflating the importance of the study
-   I also (briefly) discuss with students the importance of situating their findings within the wider context (i.e. why is it important/does it link to theory etc.?).

### Peer review of the Discussion section

-   As students don't get feedback from supervisors on their Discussion sections, I discuss doing peer review with them.
-   Either I can organise it or they can organise it within themselves (they usually self-organise along methods in some way (qual reading qual etc.))
-   I provide them with a [some guidance for completing feedback](https://gla-my.sharepoint.com/:w:/g/personal/ashley_robertson_glasgow_ac_uk/EVXw3yeJ3VdAnCDio29Mwl0B0m0FrkMGAtf85XJQIG4tYA?e=5QVmlB)
