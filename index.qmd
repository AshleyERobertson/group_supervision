# Overview {.unnumbered}

I initially designed this resource to help structure my group supervision sessions, and have now set it up as a Quarto book to share with others. 

There are a range of different resources contained within this book. In the section below, I give an overview of how I supervise and how my group supervision is structured. In the chapters that follow, I break down, week-by-week, what I cover along with the resources I use.

If you are interested in using any of these resources, please do! Feel free to pick and choose/adapt any of the resources, incorporating what you want into your own supervision practice. 

Where there are internal resources that I've used, I've either linked to the original source or have said who the resource has come from. Where there are external resources, I've provided the original source. 

 

Each week is structured as follows: 

- I start with an 'overview', which is what I'm aiming to cover in that session 

- I'll break down what I usually discuss with students. 

- If there are actions for the following week, I usually note these, to remind me to tell them in the session

- I will then have a section at the end linking to resources I made up, internal resources (these are resources from other people within School of Psychology and Neuroscience at the University of Glasgow) and/or external resources that I pass on to students. 


## How I structure my supervision

The way I run my dissertation supervision is: 

- Level 4 students have a combination of individual supervision and group supervision (switching between each on a weekly basis). I, personally, like having both types rather than just doing group or individual. 
- PGT ODL students have individual supervision (30 mins) on a fortnightly basis (this is because they are part-time and online distance-learning). I also hold a couple of group sessions through the year to get them in touch with each other so they can provide peer support, although many work full-time or in schools etc., which combined with time zones, makes it difficult to find a time to suit everyone. I record these so everyone can benefit.  

Therefore, most of these resources apply to my UG dissertation students, but could easily be applied to PGT, especially those studying on campus.  


### Setting expectations with students

In 23-24, I made up sways to detail the supervision process for both [Level 4 students](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/QTCoK14sojeLoUd3?ref=Link) and [ODL students](https://sway.cloud.microsoft/Pb5M1b1TEdgxdquK?ref=Link). They were well-received, but the students who went out of their way to tell me that they found it helpful were those who were neurodivergent, as it meant they knew what to expect. I think they would also be quite helpful for international students, as previous supervision experiences at university might have been very different. 

I've linked to examples of the sways above (please feel free to duplicate for your own use), but have also included the content in [Appendix A](https://ashleyerobertson.github.io/group_supervision/appendix_a.html)
