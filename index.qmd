# Overview {.unnumbered} 

In this book, you will find the resources you need to complete the qualitative project for your Research Methods 2 course. 

We will work through the book step-by-step, linking to relevant sections on Moodle. However, as the resources are made available from the start, you will also have some flexibility to work at a pace that suits you. 

You will become familiar with the book in Semester 1, as we will ask you to look at certain sections to accompany the lecture content. However, the book will become most relevant in Semester 2, when you complete your larger assignments. 

You will find links to each chapter at the left hand side of the page, and then there will be links to each heading within a chapter at the right hand side.
